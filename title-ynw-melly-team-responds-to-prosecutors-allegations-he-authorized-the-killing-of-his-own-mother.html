The State of Florida is reportedly seeking the death penalty for the crime, while Melly continues to proclaim his innocence.</p><p>But on Sunday (June 26), No Jumper shared an Instagram post with alleged paperwork tying <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>YNW Melly</a> to another outrageous allegation. According to the document, Melly allegedly green-lit the potential murder of his mother.</p><p>When asked if prosecutors thought Melly commissioned any crimes, the response was, “Yes. If you read his phone, there’s narcotics trafficking and firearms violations authorizing the killing of his mother. Those are the things that you would consider ‘authorizing.’”</p><p>As the post began to gain traction, a PSA showed up on YNW Melly’s Instagram Stories that read, “LIES. FALSE AGENDA. INNOCENT!!” Whatever the case, prosecutors are confident they have a slam dunk.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Detective Christopher Williams will be called to the stand as an expert witness during the forthcoming trial, where he’ll testify it’s highly probable Melly was the triggerman — not co-defendant Cortlen Henry. During the initial investigation into the murders, authorities determined Melly shot the two men while Henry staged the crime to appear like a drive-by shooting.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/06/220611-ynw-melly-youtube.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>YNW Melly Murder Case Detective Says Melly 'More Likely' Was Triggerman</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 11, 2022</p></a><p>Williams said he reconstructed the shooting by looking at the blood spatter from the crime scene and angles from which the two men suffered gunshot wounds. In his analysis, he determined the shooter was in the backseat of a vehicle behind the driver and opened fire no more than eight inches from the victim’s face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnZn96g46toK2klWPGr8OMppylpKliwaatzGapnqugpLulv4ytpmaooqTApq%2FUraarq12Wua2xxpqroqeeqHqpsYyarK2gn6e2u7HDZquhnV2gtq24yKeeZqeWYrWqv4yorqdlnaTBqbHR</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
