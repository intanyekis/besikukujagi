From<a href=#><strong> David Foster</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Nikki Sixx</strong></a>, many famous fathers have welcomed children in their silver years.</p><p>The composer, for example, was 69 years old when he married <a href=#><strong>Katharine McPhee</strong></a> in London. The <a href=#>American Idol </a>alum was 34 years his junior and had never had children, while Foster was the proud dad of six daughters.</p><p>The Grammy winner welcomed Allison in 1970. The Canada native placed his eldest child for adoption at the time, but they reconnected later in life. After Foster wed<strong> B.J. Cook</strong> in 1972, the singer gave birth to Amy. He also shares <a href=#>Sara</a>, Erin and Jordan with<strong> Rebecca Dyer</strong>.</p><p>One year after his and McPhee’s <a href=#>ceremony</a>, news broke that the Los Angeles native was <a href=#>pregnant with their first child together</a>. The Broadway star <a href=#>subtly confirmed</a> via Instagram Stories that she was expecting, saying, “Thank you, Aperol Spritz. I won’t be drinking this anytime soon, wink, wink. But, I’m very excited! Who’s coming over for an Italian-inspired cocktail?”</p><p>The actress debuted her baby bump in December 2020, <a href=#>giving birth to son Rennie</a> in March of the following year. “We picked Rennie because I’d actually been in labor for a while, and we didn’t have a name picked out,” McPhee said of <a href=#>the infant’s moniker</a>. “We had a couple names, but my husband was on a text chain with his sisters and one of his sisters suggested an old family name. It was his great-grandfather’s name, his great-uncle’s name, so it has a long history in his family.”</p><p>As for Sixx, the Mötley Crüe rocker fathered four children — Frankie-Jean, Gunner, Storm and Decker — before starting a family with his wife, <strong>Courtney Sixx</strong>. The musician <a href=#>gave birth to their daughter, Ruby</a>, in July 2019 when Nikki was 60.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m so grateful to my Heavenly Father for blessing Nikki and me with the sweetest most angelic child of God,” the DIY expert wrote via Instagram at the time. “I never knew this kind of love existed. I am so excited to be a mommy and know Nikki will be the most wonderful daddy ever just as he has been with my four stepchildren. We are home getting settled and Ruby is doing fantastic. … She [is] healthy with a full head of hair (Nikki) and long legs (me).”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see other celebrity dads having kids late in life, including<a href=#> <strong>Richard Gere</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Mick Jagger</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYrGisNJmrqGnXZ2upXnCoaClnKKau264wK2cZqGeYrmqssRmrm1tZ2l%2BeXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
