Same time I started,” Flair tells Cooper. “He came to Minneapolis to complete his training while I was there and Verne Gagne, the promoter and the guy that broke me in had me drive Andre around like to Chicago and Milwaukee from Minneapolis any marquee event he was at, usually like the big cities. And so I just drove Andre down, and then like in Chicago (they didn’t put this in the HBO special) I would take him to Rush Street, man it was a great time. He was a character. Every woman alive is fascinated by a 7’4″ man (laughs).”</p><p>I wasn’t ‘The Nature Boy,’ I was just a fat boy then, but heh, if I had ‘The Nature Boy’ going on back we would have had a lot more fun.”</p><p>Flair then goes on to tell the story of how he once witnessed Andre drink 106 cans of beer in one evening.
