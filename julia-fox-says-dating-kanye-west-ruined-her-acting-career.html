Though it’s been almost a year since they dated, Julia recently reflected on the negative impact it had on her career as an actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=#>After this whole big relationship</a> and all the things that followed, I definitely felt like, oh I feel a shift in like the acting way, not in a good way," she said while appearing on Emily Ratajkowski's podcast High Low with EmRata.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest Loses Over $30 Million Selling Beverly Hills Home</a></span></p><p>"It's like I'm not getting as many offers as I was before, weirdly," Julia continued, saying she fears she’s seen as a "liability, just tabloid type of person.”</p><p>Though he’s been long known for his controversial behavior, Kanye has faced recent backlash for a series of anti-Black and anti-semitic comments. A growing number of brands have cut ties with the rapper, including Adidas, who have announced their plans to <a href=#>still release Yeezy products but without Ye’s involvement</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if she now feels typcast, Julia continued, "Before [I dated Kanye West] I was really typecasted as a pervy Italian girl and now I'm just like skinny and look sickly and it's like, I don't know."</p><p>"It's fine, I'm so busy. I think things come to you at the right time, so that's why I'm really not stressing," she continued. "I really don't care."</p><p>This isn’t the first time the Uncut Gem star has opened up about her time with Ye. In September, she said that Kanye pursued her after he got her “<a href=#>number through a mutual friend</a>.”</p><p>However, she said she quickly realized the relationship wasn’t sustainable. "Real life set in and the lifestyle wasn't sustainable,” Julia continued. “I couldn't fly away once a week. And I tapped out at the first sign of a red flag."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The unresolved issues that he was dealing with," she added. “It just seems like he had a lot to work on, and I just don't have time for it, or energy. I don't have the bandwidth or emotional capacity for it."</p><p>Julia has previously defended her history of dating billionaires, saying she doesn’t feel guilt for using for their money. But with the “red flags” she saw in Kanye, even his fortune couldn’t make her stay.</p><p>Since losing his nearly-decade-long collaboration with Adidas, <a href=#>Forbes</a> has reported <a href=#>Ye is no longer a billionaire</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Olivia Cuplo Couldn’t Afford Groceries, Rent After Nick Jonas Break-Up</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Forbes</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8muo6KZXZu8uXnSmrCsZZSWwaq6xmaimqapmnq4sdKtZKutmaOypXnHnqlmmZOptq%2BzjJyYq52Vp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
