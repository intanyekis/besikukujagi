Seeing other women that I could possibly learn from and interact with - and even become friends with - is what excited me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=representing-nigeria-was-another-major-drawcard>Representing Nigeria Was Another Major Drawcard</h2><p>Networking opportunities aside, another major factor in Chioma signing on to do Real Housewives of Lagos was being able to represent both her city and her country on a global scale.</p><p>Especially because, as she pointed out, she would play a part in dispelling myths about the African continent, in general.</p><p>"On the international scene, when people think of Africa, they think of mud huts and lions and zebras, and it's not just that. There is so much more that makes us who we are, and to think that I was able to be one of the people to showcase some of the core values and the beauties of Nigeria makes me super, super proud. I hope I did well in that respect."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for what she's most excited for international audiences to learn about Nigeria on the show, she continues, <strong>"Nigeria is such a beautiful country. It's rich in culture, fashion, language, and heritage. All these great components make up this country that a lot of people don't often get to see."</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>EXCLUSIVE: RHOP's Wendy Osefo Opens Up About Her Soon-To-Launch Home Essentials Line</a></span></p><p>The best part, though? This is just the beginning of more Nigerian representation on a global scale.</p><p>"The truth is, there is so much more to see. We show you guys a snippet of what there is to see about Nigeria, and there's so much more where that came from. It just fills me with so much pride and joy to know that I was one of the pioneers of showing what the essence of Nigeria is to the international community."</p><p>We'll be waiting in anticipation!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chioma-shares-what-she-39-s-excited-for-fans-to-see-from-39-rhol-39>Chioma Shares What She's Excited For Fans To See From 'RHOL'</h2><p>So, aside from seeing a new side to Nigeria, what can fans expect to see from the very first season of Real Housewives of Lagos?</p><p><strong>"There's so much to see, oh my goodness!"</strong> Chioma laughs, trying to pinpoint her top picks.</p><p><strong>"So, one thing I'm not excited for them to see is the drama - but I know that's what everyone lives for ... and trust me, there's a lot of it!" </strong>she jokes.</p><p>"What I <strong>am</strong> excited forpeople to see, though, is the fashion, definitely. Nigeria is made up of three major tribes: Igbo, Yoruba, and Hausa. Three very different tribes with some similarities, but you'll definitely see the different tribes showcased both food-wise, and fashion-wise. Fashion-wise, especially. Even at the reunion, we all dressed up in our different cultural attires."</p><p>On top of that, she's excited for everyone to see the city itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>EXCLUSIVE: Is Wendy Osefo Considering A MAJOR Career Shift?</a></span></p><p><strong>"You'll also get to see the vibrancy of the Lagos metropolis," </strong>she promises.</p><p>"The luxurious beaches, the mansions in Ikoyi and Lekki, the fast cars, the hustle and bustle of the people."</p><p>However, she also points out that viewers can expect to see a full and accurate depiction of the city.</p><p>"You'll see a little bit of the slums, like with my foundation, the Goodway Foundation. I went to one of the slums in Lagos, one of the communities that my foundation had adopted, so you'll see that, and see us speak to some of the ladies. It just gives a good general insight to the nitty-gritty of Lagos."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"So," </strong>she concludes, <strong>"You'll see the good, the bad, and the ugly."</strong></p><p>We couldn't be more excited!</p><p>Catch up on episodes of <strong>Real Housewives of Lagos</strong> every Saturday on <strong>Hayu</strong>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Exclusive: Wendy Osefo Speaks About her Upcoming Book (And The Details Set To Surprise Fans Most)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaGfoq5utcqoorCtXaeyoriMoaauq5Wstrex0mamn2WclrSwv4ysq5qqXZ67tbHRr6Cer12staLAjKKrZqWVlru0edOoZKudoKeytLHNrWSnoZeav6qtjKilZpldnLmwrsClZKyskZyycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
