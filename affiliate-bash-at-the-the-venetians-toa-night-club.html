I spent the final night in Vegas on the casino floor and catching up with some friends… there’s no sleeping in Vegas! So let’s go back a couple days and recap on Affiliate Bash.</p><p>One of the highlights of AffiliateSummit was the killer party that was thrown at the Toa night club. This was such a great party, that it took multiple sponsors to host it. The platinum sponsor list included PepperJam Network, RocketProfit, Forge and Blue Man Group. This was also the premier party for the Blue Man Group’s Affiliate Program to go live. In honor of the release of their new affiliate program, the Blue Man Group gave a special 15 minute performance. Unlike their other shows in Vegas, this was in a much smaller room and we were all just a few feet from the stage. You can visit John’s <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a> for a video of the full performance.</p><p align=center><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2298345979_03717fdf8f.jpg onload=show_notes_initially() height=375 width=500 title alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><strong><span>The Blue Man Group were right in the crowd at some points.</span></strong></p><p align=center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2299140754_6f1452b3ee.jpg onload=show_notes_initially() height=375 width=500 title alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><strong><span>Everyone on the floor getting ready for the show.</span></strong></p><p align=left>In addition to the live show, the food was amazing, and so were the private access rooms offered by the platinum sponsors.

The music was also low enough so you could actually interact with others and hold a conversation. This was the first of many Affiliate Bash parties to come, I’m looking forward to seeing what they might throw together for Affiliate Summit in Boston later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunCtxZ%2BgpaGRqbJursCsn2aZpGLBqbGMrZ%2BeZaaau6bAyJqlrGWkpK5uusign61lk6HCo3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
