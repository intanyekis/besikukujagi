Today I will introduce another campaign that has the same high quality branding to it’s name, and that’s Gevalia Coffee. Like Omaha Steaks, this has been one of the best and consistent money makers in the affiliate marketing space for some time now. While competition in the “coffee” area can be tough, the combination of a high commission payout and the incentive of a free 12-cup coffee maker, it shouldn’t be tough to have success with this offer.</p><p>Gevalia is spread across a decent amount of affiliate networks, and most of them with their own unique twist to the campaign. Hydra Network and offers ranging from $10-$13.25 cpa, which all offer a free coffee maker and the campaigns are also divided up by banner/search promotions. NeverBlueAds has a $13 payout on any leads that try request any of their four 1/2 pound packages of coffee for $29.95, and receive a Deluxe Coffeemaker and Stainless Steel Coffee Scoop as a special gift. Lastly, Gevalia is also available through AzoogleAds, with a payout of $14.50. Through AzoogleAds you have a various amount of promotional ad copies for banners, text and search marketing. Each network has their own specific campaign setup for individual marketing, so make sure if you are promoting through search, to only grab the search urls.</p><p><strong>Landing Page Screenshot:</strong></p><p><strong>Participating Networks:</strong><br><strong>– Hydra Network</strong> (CPA),<strong> NeverBlueAds</strong> (CPA) &<strong> AzoogleAds</strong> (CPA)</p><p><strong>Commission Rates:</strong><br>$10.00-$14.50 per Lead</p><p><strong>Traffic Allowed:</strong> Search, Banners, Text, Email</p><p><strong>Related PPC Keywords:</strong><br>coffee, discount coffee, coffee makers, coffee gifts, gourmet coffee, free coffee, premium coffee<br><span style=font-size:x-small><span style=background-color:#ff0>(Refer to my Super Affiliate Guide section for pay per click marketing tips.
