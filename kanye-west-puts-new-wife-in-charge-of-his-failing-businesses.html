She has been around Ye for about three years, things got serious really fast in mid-November,” a source told The Sun.</p><p>"Bianca handles Ye's daily logistics from Yeezy clothing management to construction of the new Yeezy headquarters/ Donda Academy,” they continued. "She takes all his calls, and all business affairs go through her. It seems to be working out well so far."</p><p>However, this is reportedly worrying those close to Kanye. The same source alleges people are skeptical of Bianca’s motivations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye and Bianca weren’t publicly linked until after they tied the knot in January 2023. Though the pair reportedly held a wedding ceremony and consider their union to be legitimate, they’ve yet to file for a wedding license.</p><p>They reportedly met through Kanye’s Yeezy brand, which Bianca started working for in 2020.</p><p>Both Kanye and Bianca are facing a multitude of challenges with his businesses. <a href=#>Ye lost this billionaire status after Adidas cancelled</a> their Yeezy collaboration following the rapper’s anti-semitic and anti-Black comments.</p><p>Yeezy has been floundering since then.

His former business manager filed a $4.5 million case for unpaid wages and breach of contract after Ye allegedly fired him without cause.</p><p>He’s also had to make a number of undisclosed settlements to ex-employees over toxic workplace and discrimination allegations. Other lawsuits Kanye is facing include a <a href=#>$250 million defamation case filed by George Floyd’s family</a> over untrue comments the Yeezy founder made about George’s death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, <a href=#>Kanye West’s attorneys officially served him notic</a>e that they were quitting.
