Competing at over a quarter of a century of shows and procuring the most incredible undefeated streak in professional wrestling history, he is a WrestleMania icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 WWE WrestleMania Moments That Left Fans Speechless</a></span></p><p>Over the years he has faced some of the all-time greats at the show, such as Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Triple H, John Cena, Edge, CM Punk, Batista, Kane, Jake Roberts, and more. There are many wrestlers who didn’t end up getting a chance to end the streak though, with many dream matches at WrestleMania that fans didn’t get to see for The Undertaker.</p><h2 id=bret-hart-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Bret Hart Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/undertaker-v-bret-summerslam-1997-cropped.jpg><p>The Undertaker and Bret Hart never really had a long and extended feud, but they did manage to face off a couple of times, <a href=#>such as at SummerSlam 1997</a>. It never felt like they reached the heights that they could’ve done though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a stage like WrestleMania, these two men could have really stolen the show. In fact, if Hart’s career hadn’t come to an early end, and he continued wrestling into the 2000s when Undertaker’s in-ring work really shot up, there could have been an all-timer on our hands.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chris Jericho Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chris-Jericho-Undertaker-Royal-Rumble-2009.jpg><p>Surprisingly, The Undertaker and Chris Jericho only had a handful of matches over the years, despite both being in WWE for decades. Whether it be during the Attitude, Ruthless Aggression, or PG Era, this would have been a WrestleMania match that would have stolen the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jericho is someone who was overlooked at times, being one of the biggest names to never win a Royal Rumble for instance, and it was also the case when it came to the list of legends who stepped up to The Undertaker, as Jericho wasn’t one of them.</p><h2 id=randy-savage-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Randy Savage Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_20230215_210021_-1000_x_500_pixel.jpg><p>The Undertaker and Randy Savage never had a televised singles match, making this a big dream match in any sense, not just for a WrestleMania. Of course, the crossover period of their tenures in WWE was fairly short, but there was time to make this happen, especially on a stage like WrestleMania.</p><p>Allowing a young Undertaker to get in the ring with a veteran like Savage, who was still a top performer, would have been a great way to establish The Deadman at WrestleMania.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rock-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Rock Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-rock-the-undertaker-smackdown-2000-cropped.jpg><p><a href=#>Although The Rock and The Undertaker</a> were both big parts of the Attitude Era, it is surprising how infrequently they came to blows. When looking at the long list of names that The Undertaker faced at WrestleMania, it is surprising that The Rock was not one of them.</p><p>This could have main evented any show during any era of The Undertaker’s time in WWE. In fact, it would have been likely accepted if one of his return matches with John Cena was sacrificed for a dream encounter with The Undertaker.</p><h2 id=mankind-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mankind Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-undertaker-v-mankind-king-of-the-ring-1998-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mankind is one of The Undertaker’s most legendary opponents, with the pair having an array of memorable matches in the late 1990s. However, their rivalry never made it to the WrestleMania stage, which feels baffling when considering the amount of other PPVs and shows they battled on.</p><p><a href=#>Running a rematch of their iconic Hell in a Cell</a> match would have been far better for WrestleMania than say the ludicrous match between The Undertaker and Big Boss Man inside Hell in a Cell. Even as “Mick Foley”, “Cactus Jack”, or “Dude Love”, this would have been a dream WrestleMania match.</p><h2 id=steve-austin-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Steve Austin Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steve-austin-v-the-undertaker-raw-july-29-1996-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Steve Austin is another name who fought The Undertaker a lot</a>, but never found himself competing against The Deadman on the WrestleMania stage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Time A Heel Won In The WrestleMania Main Event, Ranked</a></span></p><p>This would have no doubt been a great sports entertainment showcase between two major stars, but it, unfortunately, didn’t happen at WrestleMania, with each man busy with other feuds at the time.</p><h2 id=daniel-bryan-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Daniel Bryan Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Daniel-Bryan-Elimination-Chamber-2019-Cropped-1.jpg><p>Towards the end of The Undertaker’s time at WrestleMania, he faced the likes of John Cena, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Shane McMahon, and Roman Reigns. However, these matches didn’t deliver. If he was in the ring with Daniel Bryan, then there was a chance at one last “classic” Undertaker match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bryan is simply that good, and he would have worked well to bring the best out of The Undertaker. WWE should have tried to capitalize on The Undertaker wrestling the stars of today rather than the ones of the past.</p><h2 id=kurt-angle-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kurt Angle Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kurt-Angle-v-Undertaker-No-Way-Out-2006-Cropped.jpg><p>Kurt Angle and The Undertaker wrestled on a few PPVs over the years, but their match at No Way Out 2006 in particular showcased the chemistry they possessed and just how good of a WrestleMania match they could’ve had. In 2006, instead of facing Mark Henry in a bland casket match, <a href=#>the pair should’ve run this one back in a rematch.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his match against Mark Henry, The Undertaker would go on a spree of show-stealers at WrestleMania, and that trend could have well started one year earlier in a major WrestleMania dream rematch with Kurt Angle.</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Seth Rollins Vs. The Undertaker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/seth-rollins-wrestlemania-31-1.jpg><p>In a similar point to Daniel Bryan, Seth Rollins is someone who would have had the best chance of getting a great dream match out of The Undertaker over the last stretch of his WWE career. Giving Rollins the platform of a WrestleMania match with The Undertaker would have no doubt done him favors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Frustrating Match Results In WWE WrestleMania History</a></span></p><p>On paper, Rollins vs. Undertaker is a great past vs. present match that should have been explored at WrestleMania.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sting-vs-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sting Vs.

There were some chances to make this happen over the years, even in a cinematic setting, but instead, it remains one of the biggest dream matches that never ended up taking place.</p><p>Imagining these two icons on a WrestleMania stage would have been something special for both them and the fans, even if Vince McMahon himself didn’t see the draw or appeal in it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeUp7KiuYyupZ2doqmurLHRZq6wnV2sv6a%2F06Wcppmenq5uucCtmqGdo2K7psLEq2Sgp6RitaK8z56lnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
