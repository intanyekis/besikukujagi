Promoting her latest single, also called “Enternal Sunshine,” in February, Ariana said she hopes her fans understand more about her through new lyrics.</p><p>“I feel like we don’t need to go into any specifics, but, of course, there’s like an insatiable frustration, inexplicable, hellish feeling with watching people misunderstand the people you love and you and anything,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said while appearing on the “Zach Sang Show.”</a> “I’m so nervous because pieces of [the album] touch on things that are real and then pieces of it are also just, like, part of the concept.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ariana Grande Must Pay Scooter Braun Big Money Despite Firing Him As Her Manager</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>He'll make even more if she releases a new album, but Ariana is fighting Scooter in court to get out of their existing contract.</span><p>The former Nickelodeon star continued, “So, what is that separation?

But within a few months, not only were the pair referring to each other on social media, but one report said Ethan had moved into Ariana’s place as he navigates his divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While specifics aren’t known about Ariana’s new album, including its release date, the singer has teased that it’s going to be very “emotional” and raw compared to her other releases.</p><p>“It says everything and nothing at the same time. It’s very vague and very specific — all at once,” she added on the “Zach Sang Show.”</p><p>“The thing that was beautiful about it was, when I was writing [Eternal Sunshine], it was with no intention for the world to hear it. I was just kind of [like], ‘Let’s just go. Let’s see what comes out,” the Victorious alum went on. “And then, when I was done, I remembered that people will hear it and sometimes, people will sensationalize things and assign meaning to certain things. And I wanted to make sure that I combed through, just to make sure that it was what I intended.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6GRo65us9GapZ2dXai1or7EZpuerJGeubR5wJ%2BdmqGiYrK1tMCnZKykkamys3nNnq5mpaWotqR5wJ%2Brnqpdl66kt8uaqqFn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
