His body was found by his brother Gabe, who was asked by Janelle to check on Garrison following concerning text messages he had sent to her and members of the Sister Wives production team the night before.</p><p>Recently, it was disclosed that Garrison's cause of death was a gunshot wound, shedding light on the tragic circumstances surrounding his untimely passing.</p><h2 id=how-kody-and-janelle-rsquo-s-kids-honored-their-late-brother>How Kody And Janelle’s Kids Honored Their Late Brother</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kody-brown-talking-with-his-hands-on-sister-wives.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the former couple made an announcement when publicly revealing their son’s death, they’ve been quiet about the status of their co-parenting relationship since. But Janelle did reveal a sweet way <a href=#>some of their kids paid tribute to their late brother Garrison</a>.</p><p>Janelle recently took to Instagram to share snapshots from a night out with Gabe and her youngest daughter, Savanah Brown. Followers quickly noticed a tattoo on Gabe's arm that appeared to read, "to the stars." When asked about its significance, Janelle confirmed suspicions that it was indeed a tribute to her late son, Garrison.</p><p>"Yes! Many of the kids got a tattoo with some version of that quote," Janelle affirmed in response to a fan's inquiry. "It was one of Garrison’s favorite movies growing up and even as an adult," she added, hinting at the inspiration behind the ink, which reportedly stems from the film Dragonheart .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, a keen-eyed follower pointed out a similar thematic tattoo in a recent photo of Paedon Brown, the son of Kody and Christine Brown. Unlike Gabe's quote, Paedon's tattoo appears to depict a constellation on his forearm. The extent to which other family members might have chosen to get matching tattoos remains unclear.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kody-brown-and-family-kody-and-robyn-brown-on-their-wedding-day.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="With The Sister Wives Gone, Kody And Robyn Brown Might Want More Babies">With The Sister Wives Gone, Kody And Robyn Brown Might Want More Babies</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Are more children on the horizon for Kody and Robyn Brown now that the sister wives are gone?</p><p>The Brown family gained fame through his role on the TLC reality series Sister Wives, which aired from 2010 to 2023 spanning 18 seasons.
