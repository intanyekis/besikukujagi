As it turns out, he dislocated his shoulder during this very episode. The moment can be spotted by fans, as it takes place when Joey is battling it out for a spot on the couch with Chandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>LeBlanc recalls the painful experience</a>, which lots of fans didn't even notice.</p><p>"We both look at each other, look at the chair, and neither one of us is sitting in it. So we both race to the chair, and I have to just step over the coffee table and land on this big, huge comfortable chair."</p><p>LeBlanc continues, "I don't even think it qualifies as a stunt. Somehow I ended up completely upside down, and I was going to land on my head between the table and the chair, so I put my arm up to break my fall and just exploded my shoulder."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Warner Bros Threatened To Fire Two Of The Main Cast Members On Friends During Renegotiations</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The injury was written into the show, with Joey apparently jumping and falling off the bed...</p><p>Although the episode was forgettable for the actor, it became an iconic one for the fans.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-no-one-s-ready-became-an-iconic-episode-despite-the-fact-that-the-show-had-a-limited-budget-for-it>The One Where No One's Ready Became An Iconic Episode, Despite The Fact That The Show Had A Limited Budget For It</h2><p>The episode aired back on September 26th in 1996.
