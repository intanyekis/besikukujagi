Same as Bill Spencer, Senior. That was how it was written when Daddy Bell was alive. Now, Baby Bell has taken over, we have already witnessed Bill break the promise he made to his dad and kisses a Logans a$$ whenever he can, along with his sons.<br>I just wonder if Massimo Marone comes back, is he going to develope amnesia, too?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Yeah, I loved Massimo, but unfortunately the actor did pass away several years ago. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/cry.png title=:cry: alt=:cry: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Stubby</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 30, 2019, 2:53pm <span itemprop=position>9</span></span><p>I do remember reading about his passing a couple years ago.

He returned to Days of our Life where he played Stefano for years. No he didn’t like Logans nor Eric. He loved Stephanie and Sally loved him. Lol. Bell didnt use him so he returned to Days until death.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvWoZitZZiWvbGxzZ6bZqyfYrqiv9KipKhnZ2iBdX2W</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
