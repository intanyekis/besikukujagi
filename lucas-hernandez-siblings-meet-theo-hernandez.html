He played for Marseille when his two sons were born.</p><p>Just like his sons, Jean-François played as a defender in his 14-year career. In 2019, Lucas stated that the pair had not seen their father since 2006, meaning the support from their mother allowed them to reach the elite level of football.</p><p>Theo Hernandez currently plays for Italian side AC Milan. He is an important part of the team’s tactical set-up due to his explosiveness from the left-back position.</p><p>Just like his brother, Theo joined Atletico Madrid in 2007.
