His proposed sanctions on Russia were harsher than the largely symbolic sanctions imposed by the government of Shinzo Abe on Russia following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Presumably, the LDP leaders fear that an uninspiring response by Japan to the Ukrainian crisis will result in a lack of support from Japan’s European allies in the event of potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan.</li><li>Fumio Kishida has often focused on a “new model of capitalism” and has said, “Capitalism isn’t sustainable unless it is something that belongs to all stakeholders”.</li><li>In March 2023, he had visited India and landed in New Delhi where he was treated with panipuri.</li><li>On April 15, 2023, a pipe-like bomb was thrown when Fumio was delivering an outdoor speech in Wakayama, Japan. Luckily, he was saved unhurt from that explosion site.</li><p>Featured Image by 首相官邸 / <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>kantei.go.jp</a> / CC BY 4.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp%2BspqGfYriqv8eim5pn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
