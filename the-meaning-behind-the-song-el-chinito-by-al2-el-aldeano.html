It invites them to reflect on their own struggles against injustice and corruption. AL2’s words resonate with those who have felt marginalized or have witnessed systemic oppression. Through his music, listeners find solace and strength, knowing that they are not alone in their fight for a better world.</p><p>Personally, “El Chinito” holds a special place in my heart.
