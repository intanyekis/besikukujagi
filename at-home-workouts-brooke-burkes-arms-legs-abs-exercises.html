Luckily, she’s also a fitness instructor with the skills to show you exactly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how to get your best body ever</a> with easy at-home workout moves that you could also do on a mat at the gym.</p><p>The founder of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke Burke Body</a> app recently demonstrated toning moves that get results fast in the backyard of her Malibu, California home. They target everything from shoulders and back to arms, butt, core and legs.</p><p>The star, who works hard to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sculpt six-pack abs</a>, 47, has always had a fitness regimen. But she understands that not everyone likes exercising as much as she does. So when she comes up with routines for her app, she told Us in December 2018, she makes sure there’s something for everyone. “I’ve found a way to take the time excuse, that element, out of it,” she said. “I can get [my session] done at home, I can get it done in a hotel room, I’m on location… but it’s really specific body sculpting, toning, tightening and lifting moves, and it’s not that challenging.”</p><p>She’s a big fan of targeted toning. “Let’s say you don’t want to work your abs this season, or you want to work your booty, or you don’t even like to work out, you want to change your upper body,” she said. “You can get really specific on the app and just choose what you want.”</p><p>“I wanted there to be a variety [of exercises], and I wanted everybody to be able to change the way they think about fitness and to make it fun. It’s not boring,” she added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Burke also likes the idea of providing exercises to do at home because “a lot of people are too intimidated [by the gym],” she noted. “So when you’re at home, you’re free to experiment. I work out with my kids, I work out with my girlfriends.”</p><p>Though the physical results of following her workouts will show up in the form of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tight beach body at any age</a>, strengthened muscles and maybe even <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>, others benefits will be more internal. “I’m all about deepening your self-care, especially when you’re stressed out,” she told Us. “So doing a little something for yourself, you’re going to have less stress, you’re going to have more energy, you’re going to be in a better mood, you’re going to look better, you’re going to feel better.”</p><p>Scroll through to see Burke demonstrate some moves you can do in your own home or backyard!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkrrV5x6iknmWnpL%2Bsu9StqmaaoqS8rLGMm6yro5WoeqK%2BzKxkpZ2XqHqirtJmnLGdopi2tLHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
