The “Cocky Af” rapper opened up to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;about her goals in film including using her talents on and off-screen.</p><p>“I definitely want to be an actress, but I also really want to be a director. For me, I love movies. I’m just definitely like a film buff. And I don’t feel like acting should look like acting. Any time I get the opportunity to act, I just behave like myself. I feel like that’s what makes it come across so naturally. Definitely, we will see some acting from Megan Thee Stallion this year,” she explained.</p><p>The Grammy Award-winning rapper continued, “I like to create. Not only do I like to write music, I like to write stories. I definitely want to see these stories come to life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Glamour.jpeg><p>The Houston Hottie is already on the right track to achieving her Hollywood goals.
