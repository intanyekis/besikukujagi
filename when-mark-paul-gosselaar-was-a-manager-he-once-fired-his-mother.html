However, as soon as he started keeping track of and managing his career-related choices, he had some significant issues with his parents.</p><p>Due to differences in their careers and finances, the actor broke off touch with Lisa Ann Russell after their 1996 marriage. His wife, Russell, had a different perspective and decided not to criticize his parents because, in her opinion, they did a great job of raising him to be a great man.
