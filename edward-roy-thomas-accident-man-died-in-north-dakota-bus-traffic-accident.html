The accident, a bus collision on BIA Road 8 in Rolette County, left 70-year-old Edward Roy Thomas deceased and 20-year-old Cole Brien injured.</p><p>Edward Roy Thomas, aged 70, was behind the wheel, heading westbound on BIA Road 8 when tragedy struck. Cole Brien, a 20-year-old, was driving a bus in the southbound direction on BIA Road 11. Both were on their way from rural Belcourt to the Sky Dancer Hotel & Casino, according to North Dakota Highway Patrol reports.</p><p>The accident took place around 9 p.m., with investigations revealing that Thomas failed to observe a stop sign posted at the intersection. His failure to stop led to the collision, causing the bus and another car to leave the roadway, ultimately rolling over.</p><p>Remarkably, Cole Brien was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision, as confirmed by the police officers. She was transported to a nearby hospital for the treatment of her minor injuries. Unfortunately, Edward Thomas was not wearing his seatbelt during the incident, and this led to a tragic outcome, as he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Edward Roy Thomas was known for his warm personality and the smiles he brought to the faces of those around him. His untimely passing has left a void in the hearts of his loved ones, as well as the community.</p><p>The North Dakota Highway Patrol continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Rolette County traffic collision. Condolences are pouring in for the family of Edward Roy Thomas, who must now grapple with the loss of their beloved family member.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ksqXDwKubZqqfrnq1tM6mmKxlkZiwqrDEp6tmpZGjeqW1xJ1koqZdo7yzwMdmm5qjn6mubq7UrGStqpGbs6qvjJqanKGUmru1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
