Seattle has been a perennial contender under Pro Bowl quarterback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Wilson</a>, and the soon-to-be 35-year-old Olsen is running out of time to win a Super Bowl championship.</p><p>Olsen got close in the 2015 season, when he helped teammate and quarterback Cam Newton win the MVP Award. Carolina won 15 regular season games en route to a Super Bowl 50 appearance, but they lost 24-10 to the Denver Broncos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olsen will have plenty of familiarity with the Seahawks. With the exception of 2018, Carolina and Seattle&nbsp;met in the regular season every year since 2012. They also met in the 2014 NFC Divisional Round (won by Seattle) and in the 2015 Divisional Round (won by Carolina).</p><p>Unfortunately, the 2020 schedule does not feature another Seahawks-Panther showdown, unless the two teams happen to meet in the postseason.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knicks Owner James Dolan Says He's Not Selling Team</a></strong></p><p>The Seahawks went 11-5 in 2019, barely missing out on the NFC West division by dropping a close Week 17 home tilt to the San Francisco 49ers, who represented the NFC in the Super Bowl. Seattle hasn't had a single losing season under Wilson, only missing the playoffs in 2017 after they went 9-7.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seattle finished with the ninth-best scoring offense in 2019, averaging 25.3 points per game. Adding Olsen to an offense that consists of 1,000-yard rusher Chris Carson, the speedy and crafty Tyler Lockett and 2019 rookie sensation D.K. Metcalf will do wonders for the Seahawks.</p><p>It's a fair one-year deal for both sides. Olsen gets the chance to compete for a Super Bowl as he nears the end of his career, while the Seahawks add a productive and respected veteran playmaker at a good price.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=#>A Brand New Trailer For Stranger Things 4 Is Here, And It Confirms A Major Fan Theory</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6ton6KatG67y6ycp2WjnrSvv4xwZKahnKG2sLqMnZyapF2strW0jKyYoqakqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
