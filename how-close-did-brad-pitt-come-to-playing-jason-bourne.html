Pitt got off to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">humble start</a>, but ever since breaking out in the 90s, he has been one of the most successful actors in all of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the onset of the 2000s, Jason Bourne was finally coming to the big screen, and Brad Pitt was offered the role. Ultimately, Pitt would not star in the franchise, opening up the door for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the right guy</a> to come along and seal the deal.</p><p>Let’s see how close Brad Pitt came to playing Jason Bourne.</p><h2 id=pitt-was-offered-the-role-of-jason-bourne>Pitt Was Offered The Role Of Jason Bourne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/061FEF00-F101-411C-886D-6B2273D2D0AB.jpeg><p>Being one of the top actors in Hollywood means that major offers are going to be coming your way on a regular basis. After all, a studio wants nothing more than to cast a proven commodity with a history of success in their biggest roles. Because of this, Brad Pitt was an obvious choice for the studio to play Jason Bourne on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to being in consideration for the role, Pitt had already established himself as one of the biggest actors in all of Hollywood. Pitt had already starred in films like&nbsp;Thelma & Louise, True Romance, Interview with the Vampire, Legends of the Fall, Seven,&nbsp;and a whole lot more before being offered the role of Jason Bourne. The man was basically printing money for movie studios.</p><p>Now, not only was Pitt in consideration for the role, but so were a few other notable stars who all could have done a good job in their own right. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a>, Russell Crowe and Sylvester Stallone were also up for the role. Crowe seems like a better fit than Stallone, especially given that casting took place around 2000 or so.</p><p>While all three names up for the role are intriguing, the studio seemed intent on getting Brad Pitt to star as Bourne on the big screen. However, the actor would have to pass on the role, though it was not due to a lack of interest on his part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt's Ex Reveals How Intense He Has Always Been About His Work</a></span></p><h2 id=he-turned-it-down-to-do-filming-spy-game>He Turned It Down To Do Filming ‘Spy Game’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/52370AFC-28F5-4CDA-83C5-3C338AE3813F.jpeg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> back in 2000, Brad Pitt was considering starring in the film, but due to a commitment to film&nbsp;Spy Game, Pitt would not be able to take the role. His lack of availability opened the door wide open for someone else to snag the gig, and it was none other than Matt Damon who got the chance to cash in and make bank by starring as the spy.</p><p>Released back in 2001,&nbsp;Spy Game was an okay success for Brad Pitt. The film had a monster budget of $115 million, and it was only able to make $143 million during its theatrical run. The studio was certainly hoping to make back a lot more, especially considering that the film was starring both Brad Pitt and Robert Redford, but star power does not guarantee box office success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Damon, meanwhile, got the ball rolling with&nbsp;The Bourne Identity, and from there, things would escalate for both the actor and the budding franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Fan Claims They Witnessed Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt's Breakup</a></span></p><h2 id=the-bourne-identity-was-a-smash-hit>‘The Bourne Identity’ Was A Smash Hit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/170CDF9E-83AC-4F49-8C14-CDF3DDBA5266.jpeg><p>Released in 2002,&nbsp;The Bourne Identity was a huge success for both Matt Damon and the studio. Having a built-in audience thanks to the character’s name value from the books was a nice boost for the project, and after making $214 million against a budget of just $60 million, a brand new film franchise was born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the years, Matt Damon has played Jason Bourne in four different movies, all of which have made a substantial amount at the box office. Not only did the films make bank, but Damon himself has cashed in while playing Jason Bourne on the big screen. In fact, Damon has made up to $26 million for a single&nbsp;Bourne movie, placing him among the Hollywood elite in pay.</p><p>Despite missing out on playing Jason Bourne, Brad Pitt has been, well, Brad Pitt. He’s made millions of dollars by landing primary roles in successful films, and he has been one of the top movie stars in the industry for years now. In recent years, Pitt even took home his first Oscar for his stellar performance in&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Pitt and Damon even co-starred together in the Ocean’s trilogy, which was a fun franchise in its own right.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Is Loving 'Minari' Star Yuh-jung Youn Roasting Brad Pitt At The Oscars</a></span></p><p>Brad Pitt had a chance to play Jason Bourne, but scheduling conflicts opened up the door for Matt Damon to land a role that has made him millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say Brad Pitt Didn't Deserve An Oscar Nomination For This Film</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8Rmm6KcXZe%2ForCMqaCtrF2YvK6xjK2mZqiclsaqusZmoZqrn6N6o7vUq6WeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
