Subsequently Tamara Mellon splashed out $22 million for Jon Bon Jovi’s almost 4,000-square-foot condo at the swank Greenwich Lane complex in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, the Hollywood honcho and the luxury shoe tycoon have already flipped the 14th-floor spread back on the market at $25 million. It’s unclear if any changes were made that might account for the $13% uptick in price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><b> </b><a href=#><b>Shawn Mendes Buys $4.6 Million Stylish Los Angeles House</b></a></span></p><p>Oak floors are stained dark, and floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the condo provide open and protected views to the south, east and west. With four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, the spacious condo opens to a 40-foot entrance gallery that leads to a sun-flooded 39-foot combination living and dining room, where a trio of French doors open to Juliet balconies. Large as one found in an upscale suburban home, the separate, top-of-the-line eat-in kitchen includes a small city-view balcony, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p>A pair of ample en-suite guest bedrooms are clustered with the laundry room in a wing of their own, while the south- and east-facing corner primary suite offers a walk-in closet plus a dressing room, and a marble bath with radiant heated floor. A large home office just inside the front door will accommodate the addition of a bathroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The listing is held by Raphael De Niro of Douglas Elliman. Taxes and common charges tally up to a hefty $16,000+ per month.</p><p>It’s not clear Ovitz and Mellon ever occupied the Greenwich Lane condo — marketing material shows the unit stripped of personal belongings and virtually staged — but certainly they have no shortage of other homes on both coasts to shack up in, not to mention a 213-foot yacht with six staterooms.</p><p>Mellon, who previously owned another condo at Greenwich Lane — a similarly sized 8th-floor unit she scooped up in 2016 for $18 million and unloaded in late 2019 for $18.8 million — still owns a mansion-sized penthouse on the Upper East side that she bought in 2009 for $20 million from Seagram heir Charles Bronfman Junior. The five-bedroom home has been for sale on and off since 2014, most recently earlier this year at $22.5 million. And on the West Coast, Ovitz famously owns a monumental tour-de-force mansion in the lower Benedict Canyon area of Beverly Hills as well as a striking über-contemporary ocean-front home on Malibu’s Broad Beach, both custom designed for the contemporary art collecting entertainment industry mandarin by innovative architect Michael Maltzan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>F.
