I have had a fabulous career because of you. All I can say in parting is that I have been honest with [y’all]. I didn’t sugarcoat a word didn’t hold back a single [syllable] of my life from [y’all]. I’ve lived a hundred lives in these 6 yrs so I not only won’t,I don’t have the right to complain. I would like to think that I’ve changed lives by changing my own, tho[ugh] I can’t be sure. But one thing I am sure of is God gives and takes away in measure. He is fair, just and forever. Amen from a man… Smile, its contageous:)”</span></p><p><span>In October 2008, the “Statistics” singer got into a heated confrontation with ex-girlfriend and mother of his children Joy Pound. Jennings reportedly kicked in the door of a house in Smyrna, Georgia, belonging to Jeff Kendrick, then fired rounds from a .40 caliber glock in the street according to police.</span></p><p><span>Jennings then fled the scene in his 2005 Corvette and according to his warrant allegedly refused to stop for officers when given audible and visual signs to do so. Driving in excess of 70 miles per hour, Jennings was eventually stopped and refused to take a sobriety test.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS STORY AT SINGERSROOM.COM</strong></a></span></p><p><span><strong>RELATED:</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6HGp7GMo5ynppmjtLR50p6lrZ2emLKledOhqZ6dXZa7pXnHmqOfZamarrO%2FjKmpoqufo3p2gJBxcGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
