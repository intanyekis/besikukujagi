The Malibu home is also one of only a handful of Ando-designed homes in the United States.</p><p>The home is a short drive to <a href=#>his massive Hidden Hills mansion</a>, designed by West and estranged wife Kim Kardashian, a property that remains occupied by Kardashian and the couple’s children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Alexandra Daddario Buys $7.3 Million Hancock Park House</a></span></p><p>The artist and entrepreneur has been staying at his $14 Million Wyoming ranch recently. The massive compound, located on one of two multimillion-dollar parcels, is where west produced and recorded a string of albums in 2018, including albums by Nas and Pusha T.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Haute Residence</a>, West purchased the home from retired Wall Street financier Richard Sachs, best known as the ex-boyfriend of Ashley Olson. The Malibu property was last transferred for just $1.9 million in 2003. Beginning in the mid-aughts, Sachs spent&nbsp;seven years of planning and construction&nbsp;along with millions to build the brutalist three-story home.</p><p>Last year, the property was listed for a whopping $75 million before being removed shortly after. West was able to purchase the property at an immensely discounted rate, but <a href=#>the&nbsp;purchase still marks the second most expensive real estate sale</a>&nbsp;for a Malibu residence this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Dirt</a>, West's new Malibu 3,236-square-foot beach house features unique designs created by Ando. Each of the home’s three levels serves a distinct purpose. The lowest floor holds three lavish guest bedrooms, while the middling level houses the public areas including a living room, <a href=#>fully renovated kitchen</a>, and powder room. The top floor is exclusively reserved for the owner, with a penthouse-level bedroom suite and rooftop oceanside terrace overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The décor is described as minimalist yet 'warm' by Marmol Raziner, an LA-based architecture firm that built the house with Ando.</p><p>The minimalism should appeal to West <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has previously shown an interest in that style of architecture</a>. <a href=#>West’s Hidden Hills&nbsp;estate</a>, which he helped design with Axel Vervoordt, a world-famous interior designer, was described as a 'minimal monastery'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Exorcist Reboot: Universal Pictures Bet $400 Million On The Horror Movie</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haute Residence</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSwnaOpeqPB2Kxkbm9daHqutculoKimXamupa3OZpinnJ9isaa%2FyKClnpxdoq6ttcGuZKGnpaiycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
