The 53-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Baywatch</a> alum became a household name when she slipped on the iconic red swimsuit, and is looking just as incredible as ever in 2021. She was most recently snapped heading out for a night on the town in Santa Monica on October 7. The blonde beauty was all smiles as she donned a low cut white crop top with long sleeves, a pair of light wash denim jeans, and knee high black boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Donna-DErrico-plunging-white-top-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>She accessorized the ensemble with a small black handbag and a pair of delicate gold hoop earrings as she styled her platinum tresses in loose curls. It’s hard to believe Donna first shot to fame almost 30 years ago as a Playboy Playmate. She was a single mom to&nbsp;son Rhyan when she appeared in the magazine’s 1995 centerfold, and landed the role of Donna Marco on Baywatch the following year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1996, she wed <strong>Motley Crue</strong> bassist <strong>Nikki Sixx</strong> and the couple welcomed a daughter named <strong>Frankie-Jean</strong>. As fans would recall, they met through her Baywatch co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></a>&nbsp;who was famously married to his bandmate, <strong>Tommy Lee&nbsp;</strong>at the time.&nbsp;Nikki and Donna later called it quits in 2006.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Donna-DErrico-plunging-white-top-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Earlier this year, Donna was seen rocking a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white bikini</a>, and served major&nbsp;Baywatch vibes. She opted for a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white triangle style top</a> and matching string bottoms, as she posed outdoors with a floral umbrella. Donna paired the barely-there swimsuit with a pair of towering nude pumps, and completed the look with a white kimono as she posed in her gorgeous <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles</a> backyard.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I never knew umbrellas could be masterpieces! Look at this one I’m holding,” she captioned her April 22 post. Donna went on to shoutout the umbrella’s designer <strong>Mario Talarico</strong>, demonstrating how it opens in a later video. “The photos just don’t do it justice. It is exquisite. Handcrafted in Italy by master craftsman @mario_talarico_since_1860 I’m almost afraid to use it! Swipe for more pics,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49xZpuZqayuta%2FHZpuopp6WeqWx0augnKddpbm2usaipaBlpKS9bq7OqKusZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
