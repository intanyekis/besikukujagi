Of course, we love him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drake has long been vocal about the role Shebib has played in his success and development, both personally and professionally, throughout his career. The boardsman, who<a href=#> has contributed to every Drake album</a> to date, has been mentioned warmly by his collaborator on several songs over the years. In 2016, prior to the release of <a href=#>his Views album</a>, the hitmaker penned a heartfelt letter to Shebib reflecting on their journey and his sacrifices made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-156673055.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Before we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto’s true legends honing your craft,” Drake wrote on social media at the time. “Thank you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding, “Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 (aka DB40 aka Cuarenta aka Bibber aka My brother). Text me when you are ready to start the next one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m%2ForfEZqOorpViu7Ctx2ZraWWjnbKjtcFmn56ZnKm1bq%2FOp5qeqp6oenJ%2Bkm1ucWlkZn1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
