Born in Queens New York in 1973, the actor has found much accomplishment and fulfillment since beginning his professional career in 1988. Besides amassing a net worth of $10 million, he is also given acclaim for his accomplishments, such as being the youngest cast member at 29 years old to<a href=#> win the Academy Award for Best Actor</a> in that category for the war drama film, The Pianist. With 53 movies as part of his resume, here are just 10 of Adrien Brody's highest-grossing movies, ranked.</p><h2 id=king-kong---550-517-million>King Kong - $550.517 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Compared to the classic Godzilla film of 1998 starring Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, and Jean Reno,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> King Kong is perhaps one of the most popular adventure monster films</a> produced. Released in 2005 but set in 1933 New York City during the Great Depression, the film follows actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) who is hired by Carl Denson, played by <a href=#>the eccentric Jack Black</a>, a financially distressed filmmaker who leaves her and the screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) under the impression that they will be sailing to Singapore to film. However, he is secretly planning to take them to the mysterious Skull Island where the unknown awaits them. While on the voyage, Ann and Jack fall in love, but the captain of the vessel, Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann) is having second thoughts. <a href=#>When they arrive on Skull Island</a> and begin filming, they are attacked by natives who abduct Ann to offer her as a sacrifice to a 25-foot tall ape named King Kong. That's when their adventures take a disastrous turn. The film grossed $550.517 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=the-village---257-641-million>The Village - $257.641 Million</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody's next film, The Village</a>, despite receiving mixed views, was actually a box office success! The period thriller film can be seen as more of a psychological film as it focuses on the gripping fear of the residents in an isolated 19th-century village in Pennsylvania. They are in fear of humanoid creatures who they refer to as "Those Of Whom We Don't Speak." The villagers have created a barrier of oil lanterns that block any of the villagers from entering the village. However, <a href=#>when Lucius Hunt, played by Joaquin Phoenix</a>, wanders into the village unannounced, and the creatures respond by leaving splashes of red paint on the doors of the villagers. Then when Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the blind daughter of Chief Elder Edward Walker (William Hurt), reveals her deep feelings for him. After he reciprocates those feelings, he is stabbed with a knife by Noah Percy, who also confesses his love for her. As the movie progresses, it is revealed that the creatures are actually some of the villagers dressed in a costume. The film goes on to gross $257.641 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-grand-budapest-hotel---163-503-million>The Grand Budapest Hotel - $163.503 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Written, directed, and produced by Wes Anderson</a>, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama that tells a story in only the way that Wes Anderson can.

Set in 1932, Zero recounts his first day being hired as a lobby boy and working under the hotel's concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). He has a penchant for seducing old, wealthy, wealthy clients, chief of who is an 84-year-old woman named Madame D., <a href=#>portrayed by Tilda Swinton</a>, whose son is Dmitri (Adrien Brody). After she mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit, Gustave is arrested under suspicion of her murder. It's even more convincing that he may be the murderer after her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum), finds out that Madame D. secured a priceless Renaissance painting, Boy With Apple, to Gustave in her will. Against a budget of $25 million, the film grossed $163.503 at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=midnight-in-paris---162-275-million>Midnight In Paris - $162.275 Million</h2><p>Despite the career-shattering allegations made against Woody Allen, he has still made a number of great movies, such as the 2011 fantasy comedy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Midnight in Paris</a>.

However, after getting drunk on a night out with Inez, <a href=#>her friend Paul played by Michael Sheen </a>and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil wanders the streets of Paris where he insists that after a 1920s car pulled up next to him, he time-traveled to the 1920s and met various famous composers and novelists of that time, such as Cole Porter, Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, and Ernest Miller Hemingway. The film was a huge success, grossing $162.275 million at the international box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=predators---127-234-million>Predators - $127.234 Million</h2><p>Released in 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Predators is a science fiction action film</a> that is the third installment of the Predator franchise.

However, the biological war drama film is much more profound and focuses on the life of a Polish-Jewish pianist named W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a classical composer who survived <a href=#>the horrors of the Nazi German invasion</a> of 1939. At the time, the land of Poland is promised help from Britain and France as they have declared war on Germany, but help never arrives. Szpilman is moved to the Warsaw ghetto and becomes part of the Nazi-controlled government, with his quarters controlled by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), who forces them to wear <a href=#>blue Star of David armbands</a> to be identified as Jews.

Some of the main actors in the film include Sean Penn as the lead, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, and Jared Leto.
