After successful stints in The Mickey Mouse Club, in which he co-starred with many future A-listers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling, and his future bandmate JC Chasez, he went on to have a successful career as the frontman of boy band NSYNC. Not only that, as NSYNC's future was in limbo, Timberlake successfully jumped onto his solo career and has been consistently making hits for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Timberlake, Chris Evans And 8 Other Celebrities Appearing In Apple TV Movies</a></span></p><p>With that being said, however, it's been a hot while since the crooner released his last album. He has five studio albums in his discography up to this writing, with the latest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Man of the Woods</a> being released four years ago in 2018. Despite its mixed receptions from fans and critics alike, the album did top the Billboard 200 chart. Its third single, "Say Something," landed him another Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with Chris Stapleton. To sum it up, here's everything the powerhouse singer has been up to since then.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-kicked-off-his-sixth-concert-tour-in-canada><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Justin Timberlake Kicked Off His Sixth Concert Tour In Canada</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To further promote the album, Timberlake embarked on another worldwide journey back in 2018. Titled 'The Man of the Woods Tour,' the powerhouse crooner kicked off his three-leg tour at Air Canada Center in Toronto on March 13th, 2018, and concluded the journey in Uncasville, Connecticut, on April 13th, 2019. The tour itself was so successful that <a href=#>Billboard</a> enlisted it among the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide tours alongside heavy hitters like Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, <strong><a href=#>Beyoncé </a></strong>and Jay-Z, Bruno Mars, and Pink.</p><p>"I treat it a lot like an athlete would because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s a very physical show and I ain’t getting any younger,</a>” he told Rolling Stone, adding, “Right before we hit the stage, I circle up with my band and dancers, we say a prayer and then I’ll make up a chant that’s specific to the city, state or country that we’re in. It’s just something fun for us to get amped up with together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake-received-an-honorary-degree><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Timberlake Received An Honorary Degree</span></h2><p>Timberlake's exposure to fame started at a very young age, hence it comes as no surprise that he doesn't get formal education like peers of his age back in the day. He graduated from the University of Nebraska High School via distance learning and received his diploma on stage during his Memphis stop back in 2000. Fast-forward 19 years later, Timberlake received an honorary doctorate degree from Berklee College of Music alongside fellow music star Missy Elliott for their "influences in music, and for their enduring global impact."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You’re defined by what you define failure as. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s not a thing if it leads you to your success. It’s all part of the journey,” </a>he said while accepting the award in front of thousands of students. “I hope that in the years to come, two things will happen: One, I will represent you in the way that you most hope for. And two, I look around and see this graduating class. Meet me at the studio. I want to see y’all!”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Justin Timberlake Has Evolved Through The Years</a></span></p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-reprised-his-role-in-39-trolls-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Justin Timberlake Reprised His Role In 'Trolls'</span></h2><p>In addition to music, Timberlake has also made a name for himself in the acting landscape. In 2020, he reprised his role as the good-hearted Branch in Trolls World Tour, the second film of the Trolls franchise after 2016. The film itself picks up what the previous one had left off and chronicles Poppy (played by Anna Kendrick) and Branch's journey to find all the six scattered tribes of trolls in six different islands of music</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake-sold-his-soho-unit><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Justin Timberlake Sold His SoHo Unit</span></h2><p>Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel, sold their SoHo penthouse back in 2018 for $6.35 million, eight years after buying it for $6.56 million through an LLC. As reported by the New York Post, the comfy 2007-built condo is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2,598-square-foot apartment with a modern-looking kitchen</a> and elegant, spa-like bathroom.</p><p>Last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they also sold their Hollywood Hills home for $35 million </a>as "they're rarely in L.A."

However, the five-piece band has made several public outings together, including in October 2018 when they reunited to congratulate Timberlake on his Hollywood Walk of Fame star.</p><p>“For all of you who came from far and wide to share this moment, this really means the world to all of us,” he recalled while accepting the award. “These four guys mean so much to me, and we’re really a family. The memories that we have and the times that we’ve shared and the families that we’ve built from it, I don’t really think I could put into words how much the four of you mean to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=backlash-against-justin-timberlake-during-the-freebritney-movement><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Backlash Against Justin Timberlake During The #FreeBritney Movement</span></h2><p>Justin Timberlake's long-documented outing with singer <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong> has also thrown him under the bus, especially in recent years at the height of the #FreeBritney movement. He broke his silence on Spears, who was the alleged subject of her Grammy-winning heartbreak anthem "Cry Me a River," on Twitter last year, saying, "Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was… what’s happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Everything NSYNC Members Have Been Up To Lately</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWaqsC1tc1mq6Klkpq%2Fra3KnmSsrJmhuW65wKSgp59dosK0tcJmrqGZpGK1pr%2BMm5yepl2qvW7AzmaqoqaTmnqurc1mpp9lpJ2ybsPOqJusZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
