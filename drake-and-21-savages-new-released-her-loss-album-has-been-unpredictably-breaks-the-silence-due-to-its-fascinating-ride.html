The 16-track release features an appearance from Travis Scott on a song called “Pussy & Millions.” A cut titled “Circo Loco” features a sample and vocal interpolation of Daft Punk’s Discovery hit “One More Time.”</p><p>Laid over an oversaturated image of a woman holding what looks to be an OVO-branded soda, the tracklist shows 16 songs in total. The album will open with “Rich Flex,” followed by “Major Distribution,” “On BS,” “Backoutsideboyz” and “Prilived Rappers,” among others. The tracklist doesn’t show any features, if there are any at all.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Drake Reportedly Announces Release Date Of New Collaboration ‘Her Loss’ With Savage</b></a></span></p><p>The list also names Drake and 21 Savage as executive producers on the LP and the rappers’ labels, OVO and Slaughter Gang Entertainment, according to <a href=#><i>Hypebeast</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rap duo hasn’t released any songs from Her Loss since announcing the album late last month but have teamed up in the recent past for chart-topping songs such as “Knife Talk” and “Jimmy Cooks.”</p><p>Her Loss was initially slated for an October 28 release, which was pushed back due to producer Noah “40” Shebi contracting COVID.</p><p>The two rappers announced their joint project on October 22. They also released a music video for their collaborative track “Jimmy Cooks,” which appears on Drake’s most recent solo LP, <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i>. The Mahfuz Sultan–directed video found the men rapping in front of numerous screens, lit up with colorful footage of city life, per <a href=#><i>Pitchfork</i></a>.</p><p>Drake and 21 Savage have worked together multiple times in recent years. 21 Savage appeared on Drake’s <i>Certified Lover Boy</i> track “Knife Talk,” while Drake guested on “Mr. Right Now,” from 21 Savage and Metro Boomin’s <i>Savage Mode II</i>. In June, 21 Savage joined Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator on “Cash In Cash Out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>Honestly, Nevermind</i> became Drake’s 11th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 albums chart, moving 204,000 equivalent album units in its first week. The achievement made Drake the fifth artist to release more than 10 No. 1 albums. Still, the rapper decided not to submit the LP for Grammy nominations, marking the second straight year he has abstained from consideration.</p><p>As noted in a recent <a href=#><i>Complex </i></a>piece from Jordan Rose, the photo on the front of <i>Her Loss</i> is actually about three years old. According to photographer Paris Aden, who captured the original image, someone from OVO recently reached out about using the pic as a cover.</p><p>“I shot that shit a long time ago,” Aden told Complex when asked about the image, which features Qui Yasuka, a.k.a. Suki Baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Johnny Depp Reportedly Appeals Against $2 Million Amber Heard’s Defamation Verdict</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Hypebeast</a>, <a href=#>Pitchfork</a>, <a href=#>Complex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxs63KnmSappRif3J50pqtmp%2BVqHqvsdZmqZ6klZbAprCMoZyrZZykwLR5wKWZrqVdna60ecGenKdlpaO9s7HDopqtmZKhxm6u0Z6YpKtdqbWmedKio56mk5p6pcHEZquoZZmpwG6ywKyaoqaRqbavs4yroJ2dXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
