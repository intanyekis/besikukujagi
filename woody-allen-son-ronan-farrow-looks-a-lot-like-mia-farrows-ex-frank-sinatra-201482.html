Granted, he looks a lot like Frank with the blue eyes and facial features, but if so what does this say? That all during the custody hearing Mia lied under oath and falsely represented Ronan as our son?”</p><p>Last October, Mia Farrow, 68, sparked a new scandal when she hinted to Vanity Fair that Sinatra could “possibly” be Ronan’s father. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Rosemary’s Baby actress</a> and Sinatra were married from 1966 to 1968. Their romantic relationship continued, however, on and off following their divorce.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woody-Allen-Son-Ronan-Farrow-Looks-a-Lot-Like-Mia-Farrows-Ex-Frank-Sinatra-2.jpg><p>“Even if he is not Frank’s, the possibility she raises that he could be, indicates she was secretly intimate with him during our years. Not to mention all the money I paid for child support,” Allen continued. “Was I supporting Frank’s son? Again, I want to call attention to the integrity and honesty of a person who conducts her life like that.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In Allen’s NYT piece,</a> the director used Mia’s alleged affair to make a point that she could also be lying about their daughter’s molestation accusations. “[Dylan] was coached by Mia Farrow,” he claimed in his article. (<a href=# rel=noopener>Farrow and Allen split in 1992</a> after 12 years together. During their heated custody battle for their adopted children <strong>Moses</strong> and Dylan, and son Ronan, Farrow accused her ex of molesting their daughter.)</p><p>“This piece will be my final word on this entire matter and no one will be responding on my behalf to any further comments on it by any party,” he concluded in the NYT. “Enough people have been hurt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawp5%2BZxm6ty6Wcp2WjpLtuvs6nmKdllpa%2Fs7vWZqOop5uoeqJ5y6irZqSZoLJuuciaZJ%2BZoqe8uL%2BMnq9mnqKWu6x50qKlmqyilnpzfJBtb2tn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
