While cities like New York City, Orange County, and Atlanta have taken over the Bravo scene, it seems as if the new ladies from Salt Lake City are coming for&nbsp;everyone else! 'RHOSLC' aired last week for the first time, and fans were instantly obsessed. We were all introduced to Jen, Heather, Whitney, Mary, Lisa, and Meredith, who have since become one of Bravo's best casting calls in a very long time! While we don't know much about the ladies just yet, we are in for quite a rollercoaster ride.</p><p>As viewers get to know the cast more and more each week, there is one thing that stands true, these ladies are rich! Each cast member is successful and they aren't afraid to show it off. From jewelry designers, realtors, all the way to owning their own liquor brands, the ladies of Salt Lake City are swimming in dough. Although other franchises see women with millions in the bank, the 'RHOSLC' is slowly but surely finding themselves in close competition with their fellow Bravo colleagues. When it comes to the richest cast member, Mary Cosby, and Lisa Barlow come out on top with net worths of $5 million each!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mary Cosby is probably one of the most fascinating women on any 'Real Housewives' show after revealing that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she married her step-grandfather</a>. Yes, you read that right, Mary Cosby married her late-grandmothers second husband, Robert Cosby Sr. The marriage was reportedly arranged per Mary's grandmother's wishes, which also allowed Mary to inherit her grandmother's estate and church, making her net worth so high!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Filming Secrets About The Real Housewives</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RHOSLC-Net-Worth-e1606002789922.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Lisa Barlow, she and her hubby are the owners of countless liquor labels, including LUXE and VIDA tequila. Lisa prides herself on her work ethic and doesn't play around when it comes to business, making it clear as to why she has done so well for herself. While they have certainly done well for themselves, Jen Shah and Whitney Rose come in second with net worths of $3 million each.</p><p>Whitney Rose, who was excommunicated from the Mormon church, married the man she cheated on her first husband with, who just so happens to be 18 years her senior. The star is the owner of her own cosmetic line, Irish+Beau, which has clearly made her millions. As for Shah, she owns quite a lot of real estate in New York City, which has allowed her to make a lot of her own money.</p><p>Heather Gay comes in next<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> with a net worth of $1.7 million!</a> Heather was married to Mormon royalty and was a devout Mormon herself for 11 years, however, in 2015, she split from her ex-husband and later distanced herself from the Church of Latter-Day Saints. Since then, Heather has gone on to own and operate one of the best medical spas in all of Salt Lake City called Beauty Lab & Laser. Despite her religious background, cosmetic surgery is something Heather has taken on full force! From supplying botox to the entire city of Salt Lake to every anti-aging treatment you can think of, Heather does it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RHOSLC-Cast-Net-Worth-e1606004758746.jpg><p>As for fan favorite, Meredith Marks, the star is a world-renowned jewelry designer!&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The cast member is worth $1 million</a> and has made her fortune designing jewels for some of the biggest names in Hollywood from Rihanna, Charlize Theron all the way to Courteney Cox.
