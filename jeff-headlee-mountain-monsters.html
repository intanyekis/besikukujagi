Not only is Jeff well-versed in the mountain terrain, but he is also well-versed in mountain folklore as well as textbook history. One of the founding members of the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings, Jeff met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Tice</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willy McQuillian</a> during his early years, and the trio set off on a unique search for the paranormal. A part of the reality TV series Mountain Monsters, Jeff has been a regular cast member since the first season. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Jeff Headlee.</p><h2>Who is Jeff Headlee?</h2><p>Jeff Headlee is an American reality television personality, researcher, and founder of AIMS. He co-founded AIM&nbsp;alongside <a href=#>Willy McQuillian</a> and&nbsp; <a href=#>Joh Trapper Tice</a>, the latter of who passed away on December 16, 2019. Jeff is Sagittarius born and comes from a Caucasian household. And according to astrological readings, males born under his zodiac sign are said to possess the traits of being outgoing and cheerful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mountain-Monsters-cast-Jeff-Headlee.jpg><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>Jeff Headlee was born on December 21, 1957, in Vienna, West Virginia, United States. He is the son of <span>Mildred Headlee who celebrated her 90th birthday on February 6, 2022. </span>Jeff grew up in his hometown where he began his schooling too. He attended Parkersburg High School and later enrolled at&nbsp;&nbsp;West Virginia University at Parkersburg.</p><h2>Personal Vendetta:</h2><p>For the longest time, Jeff led a normal life. Born and raised in Virginia, things were working out for Jeff and the man was breezing through life. Things changed for Jeff when an unidentified animal attacked Jeff’s dog. After the accident, Jeff searched for animal records trying to identify the animal that struck the blow. But to Jeff’s dismay, the search ended without any results. Since then, Jeff abandoned the regular search and started looking at mythical creatures. During this time, he met with Trapper, and Willy and the trio shared their experiences. Even though each one of them had a separate goal in mind, their objectives aligned. Over the years, the trio established the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings and began searching for the supernatural.</p><h2>Researcher of the group:</h2><p>One of the unique features of the AIMS group is that their jobs are well-assigned. Each member of the team has a specialty and does related work. Of the original three, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John</a> was an expert trapper and also doubled down as the team leader. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willy</a> also worked as a trapper but often put a creative spin on his traps. Unlike the previous two, Jeff had no prior experience in hunting and worked as the team’s resident researcher and technology expert. During the team’s nightly hunts, Jeff is left in charge of the thermal camera. Quick on his mind, Jeff often lines up witnesses for the team’s investigations. Even though Jeff receives less screen time than his co-workers, he works tirelessly behind the scenes to analyze the information on hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mountain-Monsters-cast.jpg><h2>Trouble along the way:</h2><p>With no prior experience, Jeff had trouble during the first few seasons of the show. He simply recorded too many sightings. This made it difficult for the group to analyze the information on hand. As most hunts are carried out during the night, Jeff could not effectively figure out what he was seeing. But over the years, he grew familiar with the technology and learned from his mistakes.</p><h2>Mountain Monsters:</h2><p>Jeff Headlee is a cast member of the reality television show “Mountain Monster.”&nbsp; The show follows a team of hunters and trappers from West Virginia, known as the “AIMS team,” as they search for and investigate alleged sightings of mysterious creatures in the Appalachian Mountains. The team uses a variety of techniques, including tracking and trapping, to try to capture or gather evidence of these creatures. They also often interview local residents who claim to have seen the creatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff made his show debut in 2013 on season 1, episode 1 titled “Wolfman of Wolfe County.” He then regularly appeared making 80 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearances</a> until season 8 in 2022. Jeff did not win any awards or nominations for his involvement in the reality television world.</p><p>When not hunting for bigfoot and monster-like creatures, Jeff Headlee is involved in business endeavors of his own. He is the owner and operator of the Antique shop “<span class=rse6dlih>H&S Trading Post” in Waterford, Ohio.</span></p><h2>Net Worth:</h2><p>Jeff brings in a considerable sum of money from Mountain Monsters.
