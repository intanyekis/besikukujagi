The fitness model shared stunning glimpses of her baby bump ahead of welcoming her and <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a>’s son in December 2021.</p><p>The professional basketball player was already the father of two — son <a href=#>Prince</a> and daughter <a href=#>True</a> — and dating on-again, off-again girlfriend<a href=#><strong> Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> when he conceived a baby boy with the Texas native in March 2021.</p><p>“I met Tristan in 2020 at a party at his home in Encino, California. He told me he was <a href=#>single and coparenting</a>,” Nichols claimed in a statement nine months later. “I would never have gotten involved with Tristan if I thought he was in a relationship.”</p><p>The new mom went on to say in December 2021 that she allegedly “communicated daily” with the athlete, adding that she saw the Canada native “several times” every month.</p><p>“Despite the challenges that I know I would have as a single mother and Tristan’s reaction to my pregnancy, I told Tristan I would be having the baby,” Nichols told Us at the time. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with Tristan. My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment.”</p><p>Court docs revealed that same month that the former personal trainer had <a href=#>sued Thompson for child support</a> in June 2021. The Sacramento Kings player <a href=#>confirmed his paternity</a> one month after <a href=#>Nichols gave birth</a>.</p><p>“Today, paternity test results reveal that I fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that paternity has been established, I look forward to amicably raising our son,” the power forward wrote via Instagram Stories in January 2022 before going on to apologize to Kardashian.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Khloé, you don’t deserve this,” Thompson added. “You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you. You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years,” he shared. “My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you. I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”</p><p>The former Cleveland Cavaliers player began dating the<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians </a>alum in 2016, and Thompson <a href=#>cheated on her two previous times</a> — once while the reality star was pregnant with their daughter in 2018 and again the following year with<a href=#><strong> Kylie Jenner</strong></a>‘s then-best friend<a href=#><strong> Jordyn Woods</strong></a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to revisit Nichols’ baby bump photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuqK%2BwKWcnmWenrCpu8usZJuZkq56o8HMqWSpoZOoeqK0xJqbZqeWYsGztdKtmKdlpJ28rrzSqKWsZaOku7R5waKpraBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
