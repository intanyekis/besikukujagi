The Truth About The Criminal Minds Star's Secret Girlfrien</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>There are some actors who are always compelling, just a touch mysterious, and truly great at what they do. Matthew Gray Gubler is one such star. <a href=#>The actor made great money on Criminal Minds</a>, the procedural that he starred in from 2005 to 2020. While he's always game to chat about how much he loved his character Dr. Spencer Reid, he's much quieter about the time that he spends away from a TV or film set. <a href=#>Gubler struggled with a rare health issue</a> when he began starring on Criminal Minds, and he didn't even talk about that much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Gray Gubler's fanbase is eager to find out if he's taken or if he's totally fine being without a partner for the time being. But while he has let fans know what he thinks about Reid's Criminal Minds plotlines, and he talks about some of his interests, Gubler has a tendency to be quiet about his current love life. Why doesn't the actor want to share more about his romantic life?</p><h2 id=is-criminal-minds-star-matthew-gray-gubler-single>Is Criminal Minds Star Matthew Gray Gubler Single?</h2><p>Matthew Gray Gubler will likely always be famous because of Criminal Minds. But he does have other roles behind him. From 2019 to 2022, he starred in the quirky comedy TV series Dollface. That is his most recent role.</p><p>Sadly, he didn't <a href=#>return for the reboot Criminal Minds: Evolution</a>. His IMDb page doesn't have any upcoming TV shows or films. It's possible that he is taking a bit of a pause after playing the same character for so many years. When an actor stops portraying the character who they have become used to playing, there's a transition period that must feel pretty strange.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-gray-gubler-2.jpg><p>While Criminal Minds fans want to see Gubler on their TV screens in the future, they also wonder about the state of his personal life. After all, he's a really cool celebrity who posts Instagram photos of himself wearing costumes and goofing off. He isn't afraid to show off his silly personality. And, judging from his Instagram account, he also loves Halloween a lot.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Criminal Minds' A.J.

According to Amo Mama, he might have been in a relationship with Marisa Morris, a model from Portugal, back in 2008. And in 2004, he might have been in a relationship with Charlotte Kemp Muhl, but people were concerned about the age difference between the then 24-year-old actor and 16-year-old Muhl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-gray-gubler-1.jpg><p>While those relationships haven't been confirmed, Gubler did talk about dating Kat Dennings and being pals with her after.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Gray Gubler also dated Taylor Swift</a>, which is a romance that fans definitely want to hear about. Hollywood Life reported in 2013 that they were seeing each other casually. A source said, “Stuff is brewing. They are definitely going to try to hang out this next week or two as she’s in Los Angeles for her tour. We’ll see how sparks fly from there. The potential is great but we’ll see.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-s-tours-have-been-outrageous-and-filled-with-controversies-the-truth-about-what-really-happened-behind-the-scenes.jpg><p>The source told Hollywood Life "mutual attraction has led to some hangouts but they are not exclusive."</p><p>Cosmopolitan reported that it seems that Gubler was at the Fourth of July party that the singer threw in 2013. Gubler and Swift never confirmed that they were together, and it's unknown how long they went out.</p><p>If Matthew Gray Gubler dated anyone else, no one seems to know about it. And as of the summer of 2023, he seems to be single. Or maybe he is keeping a relationship under wraps and will share when he wants to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-matthew-gray-gubler-private-about-his-love-life>Why Is Matthew Gray Gubler Private About His Love Life?</h2><p>When Matthew Gray Gubler is single or in a relationship, the actor doesn't say much about his personal life. Since he has been linked to actress Kat Dennings and singer Taylor Swift, that does seem logical. He might feel like he would be invading their privacy if he said anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-gray-gubler-3.jpg><p>And since there is always a lot of attention surrounding Swift's romantic life, Gubler might not have wanted to add to all that.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does A.J.

He has a really positive point of view about love and relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Gray Gubler talked about dating</a> in an interview with Buzzfeed in 2017. That year, he starred in the movie Newness, a drama about many characters struggling with love.</p><p>From his comments, it's possible to guess that Gubler is a hopeless romantic and that he does want to find love again. He told Buzzfeed, "Aww, you have to believe in love. That's the most important thing. I refuse to believe that there's no one out there for you. Even the biggest Scrooge McDuck deep down believes [in it]. Maybe they were hurt by love and now don't believe in it, but you always have to believe in it. It's the most beautiful thing in the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-gray-gubler-tribeca-film-festival.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also said that couples should spend more time being present together without checking their cell phones all the time, which is definitely true. He explained, "I would try to eliminate the phone, in general, from your relationships because it is the enemy of being present. It feels to me, when you're with someone you really love, you never look at your phone."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Thomas Gibson's Career Was Never The Same Following His Firing From Criminal Minds</a></span></p><p>Gubler doesn't appear to think of himself as a big star. And he might want to just be a regular person who enjoys his career and doesn't think too much about presenting a certain image to the world. His fans have definitely noticed that it's uncommon for him to share a lot of himself.</p><p>In January 2023, Good Housekeeping reported that Matthew Gray Gubler posted "rare personal photos" on his Instagram account. He posted pictures of him when he was younger, which was cool to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWdlsG1tMSwZKCqka56qMHBpZyrZZmjeqJ50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZJyqmaK2r63LZqSippSoerTAwKtkoKGiobOztcSnm6xlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
