During an episode of her podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Tell Me with Ellen Pompeo</a>,&nbsp;the actress opened up about an intense exchange between herself and the veteran talent.&nbsp; According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>,&nbsp;she expressed high regard for the Oscar-winning actor before breaking down their past conflict.</p><p>Back in 2015, Washington directed the season 12 episode “The Sound of Silence.” Former Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;costar Patrick Dempsey, who joined Pompeo on her podcast, guest-starred in the episode.</p><p>The show’s lead actress described Washington as “crazy charismatic” and detailed how executive producer and fellow Grey’s Anatomy actress <a href=# id=auto-tag_debbie-allen data-tag=debbie-allen>Debbie Allen</a> brought on Washington to keep Pompeo’s interest following Dempsey’s exit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Greys-Anatomy.jpeg><p>“Debbie Allen was like, ‘What can I do to keep Ellen interested? What can I do to keep Ellen here?’ because after you [Dempsey] left, I was like, ‘Oh, why do I have to stay here? I’ve got to go now. Everyone’s gone. Sandra’s [Oh] gone, Patrick’s gone. I’ve got to go too,'”&nbsp; she recalled. “And Debbie was like, ‘No, no, no. You’ve got to stick around. I’m going to bring in a surprise for you,’ and she would never tell me who it was. But she knew I was a huge fan.”</p><p>Pompeo continued to explain how the entire ordeal played out. The scene the Training Day&nbsp;actor directed featured her character, Meredith Grey, in an emotional exchange with a patient.</p><p>“He went nuts on me—this is a good Denzel story,” shared the 51-year-old actress. In the scene, she improvised her reaction to the patient, to Washington’s disapproval.</p><p>“Again, we love actors who make choices, right? And I yelled at him [the patient], and I was like, ‘Look at me when you apologize. Look at me.’ And that wasn’t in the dialogue, and Denzel went ham on my ass.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Denzel-Washington.jpeg><p>Pompeo continued, “He was like, ‘I’m the director. Don’t you tell him what to do.’ And I was like, ‘Listen, motherfu**er, this is my show. This is my set. Who are you telling? Like, you barely know where the bathroom is.’ And I have the utmost respect for him as an actor, as a director, as everything, but like, yo, we went at it one day.”</p><p>Washington has not spoken publicly about the alleged conflict. Overall, however, the&nbsp;Old School&nbsp;actress said she had an “amazing experience” working with Washington whose wife Pauletta is a huge fan of the long-running medical drama.</p><p>Greys Anatomy&nbsp;premiered on March 27, 2005, and debuted its 18th season on Sept. 30.
