The Big Bang Theory actress has <a href=#>listed her Los Angeles mansion for $7 million</a>, and is presumably house hunting for something else to accommodate her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaley hasn’t owned the property for long, but she’s looking to make a sizeable profit. <a href=#>She originally bought it in April 2022</a> from Twilight star Taylor Lautner for $5.25 million.</p><p>The home sits on 9 acres of land and features more than 5,000 square feet of living space, including 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. It comes with various outdoor features, including an outdoor shower, several fire pits, a built-in barbecue, a bocce ball court, and an open-air cabana featuring a kitchenette.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Drake’s Credit Card Embarrassingly Declined While Trying To Tip A Foot Massage</a></span></p><p>At the time, Kaley had recently sold a Hidden Hills estate for $16 million. She previously bought the property for $11.75 million with her then-husband Karl Cook, whom she was married to from 2018 to 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t long after their break-up that Kaley went public with her relationship with actor Tom Pelphrey. They confirmed their relationship via social media in May 2022, and went on to welcomed their first child, a daughter named Matilda, in March 2023.</p><p>“The new light of our lives! We are overjoyed and grateful for this little miracle,” <a href=#>Kaley wrote in an Instagram post</a> announcing their baby’s birth. “Thank you to the doctors, nurses, family and friends who have helped us immensely over the last few days. We are blessed beyond belief."</p><p>Tom made a similar post on his account, writing, "My heart is full of love and gratitude for this miracle. Eternally grateful for the strength and bravery of my soulmate and best friend @kaleycuoco. You are incredible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple have reportedly been <a href=#>living full-time in Kaley’s Los Angeles mansion</a>, but it appears they may want to go in on something together to commemorate their growing family.</p><p>While the actress hasn’t ruled out more kids, fans shouldn’t expect her to walk down the aisle for a third time. In April 2022, she admitted to <a href=#>Glamour</a> she has no desire to wed again. “I will never get married again,” she told the publication. And just in case you thing she's being a tad hyperbolic, Cuoco doubles down: “Absolutely not. You can literally put that on the cover.”</p><p>Kaley and Tom may not be walking down the aisle any time soon, but it at least seems like the duo is house hunting for their forever home.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian Shades Kim’s SKKN Brand Amid Ongoing Rivalry</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmakmZyaxm6v1KiaqGWjmrmttc2gZHBlnZ65rbXOp2SmmZ6otrC6jJqdrZ2iYsSmuMKopKKml2Kzqr7SrWScoJmhsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
