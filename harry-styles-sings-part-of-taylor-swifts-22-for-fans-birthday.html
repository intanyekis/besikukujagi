The occasion marked the second time the U.K. native has referenced “22” in concert after <a href=#>he briefly recited the lyrics</a> during a 2018 show.</p><p>After a video of the “One Night Only” moment circulated online, fans of both artists took to social media to ask the Dunkirk actor to release a complete version of his “22” take. “@Harry_Styles full cover of 22 when?????” one Twitter user asked. “No thoughts just harry styles being a 22 stan throughout the years,” tweeted another fan.</p><p>The former One Direction member and the Cats actress have never collaborated on any music, but Styles has repeatedly praised his ex-girlfriend’s knack for writing songs — even the ones that are purportedly about him.</p><p>“I think about what it means to me to write a song about somebody else, and for somebody else to do that, it’s, like, flattering,” he told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> in March 2020. “Even if the song isn’t that flattering, you still spent time on it and ultimately, using Taylor as an example, she’s a great songwriter. So, at least they’re good songs.”</p><p>The Eternals star has also said he doesn’t mind if Swift — or any other exes — write songs about him because it’s also what he does.</p><p>“I think we always say that we always write from personal experiences, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like, ‘You can’t write songs,'” <a href=#>he said during a November 2014 Google hangout</a>. “And she’s really good. They’re great songs, so I’m lucky in that sense.”</p><p>Fans have <a href=#>long believed that several songs</a> on Swift’s 2014 album, 1989, are about her brief romance with Styles. One such track is even called “Style,” which includes the line, “I should just tell you to leave ’cause I know exactly where it leads, but I watch us go round and round each time.”</p><p>The “Sign of the Times” crooner, for his part, seemingly addressed his relationship with the Pennsylvania native in his 2017 song “Two Ghosts.” The first verse begins with a description of a woman with red lips — one of Swift’s signature looks — and blue eyes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, however, Styles denied that his new song “Daylight” is about Swift, despite the fact that it shares a name with a track on her 2019 album, Lover.</p><p>“You’re reading too much into it,” he said during a May 19 appearance on The Howard Stern Show. “You know I’d love to tell you that you’re spot on, but I can’t. No, sorry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmaKnxm6%2F07KjnqtdqLavs9Jmp5qqpGK8p3nTmrClp6JiwLi1xa2qZmpiYrOwvoyfmKerXZe2s8DHnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
