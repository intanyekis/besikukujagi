And then there’s Mamie…but, it would be nice that if Dru returns so then should her sister Olivia!!</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Lila</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 24, 2024, 11:55pm <span itemprop=position>2</span></span> <img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/twocentsworth/48/29418_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> twocentsworth:<p>How, I wonder will this be addressed since she supposed died falling over a cliff during a photo shoot and Sharon plus Phyllis were both there???</p><p>I hadn’t heard this, but if Diane can return after we all saw her killed, then I suppose Dru can.
