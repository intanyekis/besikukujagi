Bad Bunny was dressed in Maison Margiela in a navy suit with white and red stripes. He added a matching beret and flowers as a node to the “Garden of Time” theme. Simmons was also dapper in a look styled by Wesmore Perriott, which featured a bow tie, trench coat, and rosy glasses.</p><p>While it’s unclear if Kendall had any awkward run-ins during the evening with her exes, she may have been doing her best to avoid them completely, especially if things ended on tense terms.</p><p>Though it’s unknown if Kendall interacted with Ben or Bad Bunny, things may be especially awkward for her and the Puerta Rica rapper, given how recent their break-up was.</p><p>After a year of dating, reports said Kendall and Bad Bunny had called it quits shortly before the holidays, with the musician failing to appear at any of the Kardashian-Jenner’s Christmas events. Their break-up came shortly after the rapper admitted he doesn’t see marriage or kids in his future during an interview, whereas Kendall has been vocal about her desire to settle down one day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-almost-got-back-with-bad-bunny-recently>Kendall Almost Got Back With Bad Bunny Recently</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bad-bunny-and-kendall-jenner.png><p>Nevertheless, the duo sparked reconciliation rumors when they were <a href=#>spotted going on a New Year’s trip with friends,</a> even posting photos to socials featuring each other.
