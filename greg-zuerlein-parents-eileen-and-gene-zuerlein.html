During his junior year, the 2006 Lincoln Pius X graduate set a Nebraska state record for field goals in a season.</p><p>His collegiate career began with a football scholarship from the University of Nebraska-Omaha and continued at Missouri Western.</p><p>The St. Louis Rams drafted Zuerlein in the sixth round of the 2012 NFL Draft with a 171st overall pick.</p><p>Zuerlein’s best year came in 2017 with the Rams, which has seen him named First-team All-Pro and the Pro Bowl.

He grew up in a close-knit family that prioritized values, hard work, and encouragement.</p><p>Although Zuerlein has a legendary NFL status today, his parents were not talented athletes.</p><p>In fact, his mother, Eileen, worked as an accountant. In an interview, she joked that she was always the last person to be chosen for teams.</p><p>Well, this could be one main reason that Zuerlein did not follow the trendy path of kicking.

In fact, he was actually going to quit after freshman year to focus on soccer.</p><p>Occasionally, his father, Gene, shares his memories of his son’s games with the media. As per him, the placekicker possesses the ability to block everything out between him and the goalposts.</p><p>Zuerlein’s parents have always become his pillars of strength. Having them by his side during challenging times has helped him overcome numerous inevitable hurdles in his professional career.</p><h2>Greg Zuerlein Wife And Kids</h2><p>The NFL placekicker is married to his high school sweetheart, <a href=# rel=noopener>Megan Zuerlein (nee Kreifels)</a>, since 2013.</p><p>Megan was born to Terry and Barbara Kreifels in 1989 and grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pius X High School graduate attended Hastings College, where she played as a goalie for the girls’ soccer team.</p><p>Her noticeable achievement came after she was named Lincoln Journal Star Athlete of the Year in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Greg-With-Wife-Megan-And-Their-Kids.jpg><p>Furthermore, she is also a registered nurse who earned a nursing degree from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.</p><p>Megan is a mother to five children, daughters Emma and Morgan and sons Greg Jr., Samuel, and Nicholas.</p><p>After they tied the knot on April 27, 2013, their first child, Emma, was born in 2014.
