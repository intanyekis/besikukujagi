According to the outlet, which cited their footage and on-site witnesses, Brown was allegedly upset that party guest<a href=#><strong> Teyana Taylor</strong></a> had been ignoring him. Usher intervened on Taylor’s behalf as Brown yelled at <a href=#>the A Thousand and One actress</a> to leave the bash.</p><p class=p1>TMZ further claimed that Brown <a href=#>quickly left the venue</a> with Usher trailing after him. The outlet later reported that the Texas native — who is currently performing his “My Way” residency in Vegas — <a href=#>reemerged with a bloody nose</a>.</p><p class=p1>Neither Usher nor Brown — who are <a href=#>longtime friends and frequent duet partners</a> — have publicly addressed the alleged feud. Us Weekly has reached out for comment.</p><p class=p1>Several hours later, they both performed their respective sets at <a href=#>Usher’s Lovers & Friends festival</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Hey y’all, we’re here [and] having a great time,” Usher said in a Saturday Instagram Story video from backstage. “See y’all soon!”</p><p class=p1>The “Yeah” musician shared a second<a href=#> message</a> about the experience on Sunday, May 7. “U know we shut Vegas down right? <span class=s1>😏</span> @loversandfriendsfest. I want to give a special shoutout to these queens @arilennox @sosobrat @munilong @summerwalker for blessing the stage. Last but not least, thank u to my brother @jermainedupri for joining me. <span class=s1>🙏🏾</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Brown, for his part, also gushed over his festival appearance.</p><p class=p1>“LOVERS AND FRIENDS <span class=s1>❤️💪🏽</span>,” the “Run It” artist <a href=#>captioned</a> performance footage on Saturday. “THX VEGAS for an amazing time.”</p><p class=p1>The Lovers & Friends show — which Usher created based on his “Love” moniker — also featured sets from <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Busta Rhymes</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nelly</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jhené Aiko</strong></a> and <strong>Bryson Tiller</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Usher and Brown <a href=#>have been longtime pals</a> since the latter musician burst onto the music scene in 2005. The two artists have also <a href=#>collaborated on several duets</a>, including “New Flame” and “Party” — but Usher initially turned down working with Brown at the advice of his team.</p><p class=p1>“So there’s one thing in my career that I definitely regret, one thing. And to this day I battle with it which is why I always show support of this artist whenever he asks,” Usher previously confessed to <a href=#>Ebony</a> in 2017. “So his manager comes in. They show him to me. I was working on an album at this time, they wanted him to perform on this album. I was like, ‘OK cool.’ Then I went to my team and they was [sic] like, ‘I don’t think you should work with this artist.’ Then he left. [It was] Chris Brown.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGauq5iav26vx6ugrGWSp7y4uoyfoKCgpGKvprLOq5xmpJGoerexxpqqZqiVp7OwvsyapZydo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
