The truth behind the rumors</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Chris Tyson, also known as Chris the Meme God, is a social media personality and a member of the MrBeast crew. He is known for his prank videos, challenge videos, and reaction videos on YouTube and Instagram. He is also a friend of Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, the famous YouTuber who is known for his philanthropic stunts and high-budget videos.</p><p>Recently, there have been rumors circulating on the internet that Chris Tyson has died or has been fired from the MrBeast team. These rumors started after Chris Tyson revealed on Twitter that he is undergoing hormone replacement therapy, a medical procedure that helps transgender people align their physical appearance with their gender identity. Chris Tyson received a lot of hate and transphobia from some online communities, who mocked him and spread false information about his death or dismissal.</p><p>However, these rumors are completely untrue and have been debunked by both Chris Tyson and MrBeast. Chris Tyson is still alive and well, and he is still part of the MrBeast team. He has not been involved in any major accidents or incidents that could endanger his life. He has also not been fired or expelled from the MrBeast crew, as MrBeast himself confirmed on Twitter that Chris Tyson is his friend and that he supports him in his transition. MrBeast also expressed his anger at the transphobic comments and the fake news that have been targeting Chris Tyson.</p><p>Therefore, the fans of Chris Tyson and MrBeast can rest assured that their favorite social media stars are still together and are doing fine. Chris Tyson has not posted any new content on his social media accounts for a while, but that is understandable given the harassment and bullying he has faced online. Hopefully, he will return soon with more entertaining and hilarious videos for his fans to enjoy. Until then, we wish him all the best in his journey and his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBur8eroKxllqe8rnnMq5memaOperTAyKWjZpmcnsOmedOhnGasoqrBqXnBnp%2BippRiwamxjKuspqeiqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
