In the caption, she simply included two emojis: a pink bow and a birthday cake.</p><p>The star of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently canceled MTV reality show</a> Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, which was shot at her club in Mykonos, Greece, sat on the ground in front of a mirror in the photo with her legs strategically crossed. The only items she seemed to be wearing were jewels: a cocktail ring, a band, three gold bangles and a pair of <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But while her latest show was canceled — “perhaps not enough drama in my life for reality tv formula, as that’s not where I am in my life,” she told Us in a statement through a rep at the time — Lohan still has much to celebrate going into her next trip around the sun. As a source confirmed to Us Weekly in June, the Parent Trap star recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed a new record deal</a> to make her next album. “Lindsay is really excited to be working on new music,” the source told Us. “It’s been a minute since she’s been in the studio, but she got right back into the recording process and has been putting in a lot of time.”</p><p>On the eve of her birthday, Lohan also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> to her Instagram account of herself dancing. Shot at sunset, the video features the star wearing a white button-down shirt and no pants or shoes while she performs moves against a wall in front of the ocean. She appears much more skilled than in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#DoTheLilo video of her dancing</a> in Mykonos that went viral last summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYsCprdGeqmampZmybr%2FEpZ2inV2ku261zayrmp%2Bilrpuss6rZGxropl6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
