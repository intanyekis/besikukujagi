He was mentored in his developmental years by a renowned local coach named Aril Anthony.</li><li>He made his first-class debut for his home state of Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 2018, in the 2018-19 edition of the Ranji Trophy (the premier domestic first-class cricket competition in India). Exactly 20 days later, Kuldeep recorded his maiden 5-wicket haul in first-class cricket in a match against Punjab.</li><li>In February 2022, he was acquired at the auction for the upcoming IPL (Indian Premier League) season by the Rajasthan Royals franchise for INR 20 lakhs. Kuldeep played 7 matches that season and picked up 8 wickets which included a sensational spell of 4/20 in 3.3 overs in a mid-season match that helped the Rajasthan Royals&nbsp;defend a middling total (144 runs) by a margin of 29 runs.</li><li>In early October 2022, he picked up a match-best 8 wickets (no other player on either side managed more than 5) – 3/41 in 7 overs in the first inning and 5/94 in 19 overs in the second inning – to help ‘Rest of India’ of India defeat Saurashtra by 8 wickets in the Irani Trophy (an annual 5-day match that pits the Ranji Trophy champions of the previous season against a ‘Rest of India’ squad).</li><li>Kuldeep’s aforementioned spell of 3/41 was instrumental in ‘Rest of India’ bundling out Saurashtra for just 98 runs in the first inning of the match. Although Saurashtra fought back hard in the rest of the match, they could never really recover from that 1st-day collapse as the ‘Rest of India’ team romped to victory inside 4 days.</li><li>The story of how this match was played in October 2022 is quite interesting. Saurashtra won the 2019-20 season of the Ranji Trophy in March 2020; their first-ever title triumph after having lost the final thrice before (2012-13, 2015-16, and 2018-19). Ideally, Saurashtra would have played their Irani Trophy match in February or March of 2021 as the Irani Trophy, since 2013, has been held at the end of the following season of Indian domestic cricket.</li><li>However, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the entire 2020-21 season of domestic cricket in India was canceled. Even the following season (2021-22) was heavily curtailed and included a highly compressed version of the Ranji Trophy which was won by Madhya Pradesh; their first-ever Ranji Trophy title. That season did not have an Irani Trophy match, though.</li><li>This created confusion regarding the Irani Trophy for the 2022-23 season which was announced by the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India, the governing body for cricket in the country) as the first full season of domestic cricket in India since the COVID-19 pandemic.</li><li>Both Saurashtra and Madhya Pradesh (both 1st-time Ranji Trophy winners) were now laying claim to a place in the prestigious Irani Trophy in the 2022-23 season and to resolve the conflict, it was announced that the season would see the Irani Trophy played twice – at the start of the season (October 2022) with Saurashtra hosting a ‘Rest of India’ squad at their home venue of Rajkot, Gujarat; and at the end of the season (March 2023) with Madhya Pradesh hosting a ‘Rest of India’ squad at their home venue of Indore, Madhya Pradesh.</li><p>Featured Image by Kuldeep Sen / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqSspZyVmr1uv8SnZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
