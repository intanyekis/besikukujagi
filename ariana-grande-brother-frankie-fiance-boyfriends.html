However, not everyone knows about her older brother, Frankie. They are ten years apart in age and grew up together in Florida. The siblings <a href=#>constantly send each other support over their social media</a> and post pics of family get-togethers. Just as Ariana married her Realtor boyfriend back in May of 2021, her brother is also engaged and planning a wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Frankie Grande proposed to her boyfriend, Hale Leon, in June of 2021. Since then, he seems incredibly happy that he's found his forever person. However, this isn't the first time that Ariana Grande's older brother's love life has been in the public eye. Before meeting his current fiance and fellow actor, Hale, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankie was in a throuple relationship with another married couple</a>. Let's take a look at some of his past relationships to see how far he's come.</p><h2 id=frankie-grande-was-in-a-relationship-with-a-married-couple>Frankie Grande Was in a Relationship With a Married Couple</h2><p>Before meeting the love of his life, Frankie was dating a married couple, meaning all three people were in a committed relationship with each other. Grande told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, "Being in a throuple was so complicated…you have double the highs, double the excitement…but also double the lows, double the drama."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo Beats Ariana Grande And Kylie Jenner For 2021's Most Liked Instagram Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the actor explains that the threesome eventually decided to end things amicably and that he has no hard feelings towards the pair. He also got some attention from a brief fling with fellow Big Brother star Zach Rance. He helped Rance realize his identity and eventually come out to the public as bisexual.</p><h2 id=frankie-grande-helped-his-39-big-brother-39-co-star-to-come-out>Frankie Grande Helped His 'Big Brother' Co-Star to Come Out</h2><p>While at a Halloween party at Ariana's house, the two snuck off together into a closet to make out. This was the first time Zach kissed another man, and he was confused about what that meant for him. He later also made out with a man at a photoshoot and decided to come out publicly as bisexual. Zach revealed, "I fell in love with who he is as a person. Love can't get any more substantial than that." Although they never had a full-blown relationship, Frankie was instrumental in Zach's life, and the two are still in contact as friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For fans of the show, this isn't new news. They were extremely flirtatious on Big Brother, frequently saying, "I love you," kissing each other on the shoulders, playful slaps on the behind, etc. <a href=#>There's even a scene of them in bed together declaring their love for one another</a>. Frankie went so far as to tell Zach, "I would marry you; I would absolutely marry you." Zach responded, "Too bad I'm not gay, right?"</p><p>Zach came out as bisexual in December of 2020, while Frankie and his current flame were already deep in love.</p><h2 id=do-ariana-grande-and-her-brother-frankie-get-along>Do Ariana Grande and Her Brother Frankie Get Along?</h2><p>Frankie was born in 1983, while Ariana was born in 1993. They are half-siblings from their mother Joan Grande but are as close as full siblings. Indeed, their love for each other is very apparent. Frankie had always wanted a younger sibling, and with Ariana's birth, he gained a sister and a lifelong best friend. Just as he sends continuous support to Ariana for her singing career, she supports him in openly expressing his sexuality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Oscars 2022’: Billie Eilish, Beyonce And Ariana Grande Unsurprisingly In The Running</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, talent must run in the family because he has quite the acting chops and a high-profile career. He starred in and produced many successful Broadway plays. The pop star was just a child when her older brother came out to her family as gay.
