Jean and I, along with the whole state of Montana, are saddened by the passing of a man whose life was marked by selfless dedication to his community, state, and nation.</p><p>On the day he was born, November 31, 1925, Ted Schwinden began a life of helping others. He would eventually become a significant figure in Montana history. He distinguished himself throughout his service to his country during World War II and was posthumously honored with the Medal of Honor.</p><p>His eagerness to serve others despite his own difficulties was a reflection of a life well-lived. Gov. Schwinden was not only Montana’s 19th governor but also the state’s 23rd Lt. Gov. He dedicated his time and energy to improving his state and its citizens during his tenure in these high offices. He led Montana to prosperity by prioritizing fiscal responsibility and the welfare of residents.</p><p>The policies that Ted Schwinden championed as governor set the stage for future growth and success. Future generations of Montanans may look forward to a brighter future thanks to the improvements he has made to the state’s educational system, healthcare system, and infrastructure.</p><p>Not only will Montanans remember Ted Schwinden for his political accomplishments, but also for the dignity with which he conducted himself and the genuine concern with which he looked out for the welfare of his fellow state residents. His ability to strike up talks with people from all walks of life earned him widespread acclaim.</p><p>Let us remember this outstanding leader well and give thanks for his service as governor as we bid him farewell. His unwavering commitment to helping others is an inspiration and a stunning illustration of how one person can make a difference in the world.</p><p>In honor of former Montana governor and state leader Jon Schwinden, I propose we continue his work to better the state and people’s lives. Our dedication to the integrity, fortitude, and charity that marked his amazing life will ensure his memory endures.</p><p>Our hearts go out to his family and friends at this time of loss. Although Montana has lost an outstanding leader, his memory will remain in the hearts and thoughts of all who had the privilege of knowing him. Ted Schwinden, Governor, you may rest easy now. We deeply value your commitment, leadership, and long-term effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMGmsIysmqGvmaOxprqMqJmirKWWv7p5wqGcq6GjnbKlecWoqaadomK6sLrTmqWaZZekw6a%2BzaipZqCRqHqxrdKsnJ1lkayuuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
