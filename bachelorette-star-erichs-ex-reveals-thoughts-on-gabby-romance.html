Season 19 finalist <a href=#><strong>Erich Schwer</strong></a> is no stranger to controversy — and he once again found himself in hot water when <a href=#>texts between him and ex-girlfriend <strong>Amanda Kaylor</strong> </a>were leaked last week.</p><p>In the purported text exchange, which was published online Thursday, September 15, the reality star — who is <a href=#><strong>Gabby Windey</strong></a>’s final suitor — chose to appear on the show while he was still in a relationship with Amanda.</p><p>“I know this isn’t ideal, I wanted to do this to see if there was something else I could do with my life. I really like you Amanda,” he allegedly told the mother of one in a series of text messages that were leaked on Thursday, September 15. “I didn’t think it would be a big deal but I understand how you feel, I’m sorry and I understand if you don’t want to see me anymore.”</p><p>Amanda was stunned at Erich’s audacity. “You just expected me to continue dating you while you go on a reality show to ‘find love,’” she reportedly questioned her then-boyfriend, whom she dated from January to March.</p><p>“I am sorry I really didn’t think this all through. … I didn’t realize the implications,” Erich allegedly responded. I am sorry I thought we could get on the same page about this. I really didn’t mean for this to hurt you.”</p><p>The aspect she was most shocked by, however, was Erich’s “lack of honesty,” Amanda exclusively told Us Weekly ahead of the Tuesday, September 20, Bachelorette finale.</p><p>“I feel like it was something that he maybe had in his mind longer than … obviously I found out right before [he began filming] and just the fact that he was continuously seeing me, staying at my house,” she explained. “He let me introduce him to [my son] the week leading up to that. … In my head that’s kind of messed up to do knowing that that’s a potential option.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amanda-Kaylor-Bachelorette.jpg><p>Amanda added that she also doesn’t believe Erich’s claims about when he found out that he was selected for the show on March 10. “I was just blind-sided and hurt,” she told Us.</p><p>The pair’s relationship was “very intense,” Amanda revealed, despite the fact that it was “short-lived” and the two never put a label on it. “We were obsessed with each other,” she shared, claiming that “every single day that month he was texting me, ‘I need to be with you, I need to see you.’”</p><p>Despite the heartache, Amanda, who told Us she will not be watching Tuesday night’s finale, ultimately wishes Erich nothing but happiness — as long as he’s genuine in his romance with Gabby.</p><p>“If him and Gabby are for real, and he moved on and found someone, then I’m happy for him. I just hope that this isn’t just part of his plan to gain something from this because I mean, he really had me fooled,” she told Us, adding that if she were the Bachelorette co-lead, she “would be questioning [the relationship],” and asserted that Erich went on the reality show with “bad intentions.”</p><p>While she doesn’t know what — if anything — her ex told Gabby about their relationship, as long as “she knows the full truth and still wants to be with him and they’re happy then I wish them all the best.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelorette season 19 finale airs on Tuesday, September 20 on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ1dqMGivoyeqaKbmKh6psSMq5yvnZGhwG7Ax6isoKCkqHqwuoygmJuaqWK%2FsLnAp5qeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
