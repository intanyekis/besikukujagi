I’m like, ‘Wait, are you sure [this is my baby]?’ You can’t lose this thing!”</p><p>Rihanna and partner <strong>ASAP Rocky</strong> welcomed RZA in May 2022. Earlier this year, the “Diamonds” singer revealed during her performance at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show that she was expecting her second child. She and the rapper, 35, welcomed son Riot, now 4 months, in August.</p><p>On Monday, Rihanna said that she loves Rocky (real name Rakim Mayers) “differently” as a dad. “It’s a turn-on. It’s just like, ‘Wow! What a leader, what a great, patient, loving [dad],’” she gushed. “And my kids are obsessed with him. I’m just a background [actor], I’m an extra. Yep! It happens! … It doesn’t matter if it’s girls or boys, they love their dad differently, and I love to see it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rihanna-Jokes-Her-Son-RZA-Has-Her-Forehead-3.jpg><p>Earlier this month, an insider exclusively told Us Weekly that Rihanna hasn’t ruled out <a href=#>having more kids</a> in the future.</p><p>“Rihanna adores her boys, but she’d still love to have a girl one day,” the source explained. “She’s always wanted lots of kids, so that’s definitely something they discussed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second insider noted that Rihanna and Rocky are “thrilled to be living out their dreams together.”</p><p>Last month, Rocky said that he thinks parenthood has been some of his and <a href=#>Rihanna’s best work so far</a>. “I think we do a real great job at collaborating making children,” he joked in an Instagram interview with Complex. “I think that’s our best creation so far! Nothing is better than [RZA and Riot] out there. I mean, we had a third designer come and help, a ghost designer named God, [who] shaped everything. And we had these beautiful angels.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2BtjKOmpJ2jYrWmvoxqZLKdkad6sLjDZqqopl2nx6J5x5qqZqCVp3qjtcZmnaiqlZ2yorCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
