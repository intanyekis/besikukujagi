The Basic Instinct actress is beaming for the camera in a yellow two-piece bathing suit. “Happy Summer,” she <a href=#>captioned the snap</a>.</p><p>The Golden Globe winner appears to be makeup-free in the photo, which shows off her toned arms and defined abs. The mother of three looked like she was ready for fun in the sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sharon-Stone-63-Shows-Off-Insane-Bikini-Body-Promo.jpg><p>Stone’s famous friends took notice of the Total Recall star’s killer bod and matching confidence.</p><p>“Even the dog knows you got IT,” comedian<strong> Leslie Jordan</strong> commented, noting Stone’s pet, Bandit, staring at her in the background.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rose McGowan</strong></a> added, “You deserve all the Oscars that ever existed.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a> had trouble finding words. “OK…. JUST…. W🌞W,” the Knives Out star wrote.</p><p>Words failed many of the commenters. <a href=#>Law & Order SVU</a> star <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a>, <a href=#>The View</a>‘s <a href=#><strong>Meghan McCain</strong></a> and Ready or Not actress <a href=#><strong>Andie MacDowell</strong></a> commented with flame emojis.

The older one is working … and it’s just like, every summer when they do this, I feel like I remember me. I was cute. I was a girl. Oh yes, I’m back!”</p><p>When she isn’t busy working on her bikini body, Stone<a href=#> is swiping on Bumble</a>. The famous actress was accused of being a fraud after users on the dating app recognized her in late 2019. She had to take to Twitter to get the company to unblock her account.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Is being me exclusionary ? 🤷🏼‍♀‍ Don’t shut me out of the hive 🐝,” she tweeted.
