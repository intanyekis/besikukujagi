Not only was he a great on-screen adventurer as Rick O'Connell in 'The Mummy,' but Fraser also had family-friendly hits like 'George of the Jungle' under his belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And after the first 'Mummy' film drew plenty of attention, it seemed like Brendan was only going to get hotter in the spotlight.</p><p>But then, his movies began bombing at the box office. Despite a few successful projects, including some voice work on 'The Simpsons' and 'King of the Hill,' not to mention a 'Scrubs' run, Fraser dropped off fans' radar.</p><h2 id=why-did-brendan-fraser-stop-acting>Why Did Brendan Fraser Stop Acting?</h2><p>Technically, Brendan Fraser never really&nbsp;quit acting. But he did take a step back following some personal challenges. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an experience that left him feeling violated</a>, he retreated from the spotlight -- only re-emerging amid the 'Me Too' movement, which helped him realize he wasn't alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">factor that contributed to his career cool-off</a>? Some health problems mostly related to&nbsp;the stunt&nbsp;work he did on the set of 'The Mummy.'&nbsp;He did spend some time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recovering from multiple surgeries over the years</a>, which likely knocked him off the credits of many films he couldn't audition for.</p><p>Despite all his personal challenges, though, Fraser didn't really leave Hollywood; he's never gone more than a couple of years without some project appearing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on his IMDb resume</a>. So what&nbsp;has he been up to?</p><h2 id=where-is-brendan-fraser-now>Where Is Brendan Fraser Now?</h2><p>Brendan may have had a few and far-between projects in the last few years. Sure, shows like 'Condor,' 'Professionals,' and 'Doom Patrol' weren't massive hits for the seasoned actor.</p><p>But he has at least three projects coming up; one that's completed and two in post-production, per IMDb.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Brendan Fraser Lost His $45 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And though he's not a mega-millionaire anymore, Brendan is still relevant in some interesting ways. Though he doesn't seem to be active on social media, there are countless fan pages dedicated to commemorating Fraser's career. Even the less glamorous moments.</p><p>But the 52-year-old also has three kids and an ex-wife, so he's likely pretty busy outside of his acting gigs. And he's probably realized that he can't hang out in Hollywood forever; in a&nbsp;People interview years ago, Brendan explained that he felt a lot like the horse from 'Animal Farm.'</p><p>The actor suggested that he nearly worked himself to death, elaborating, "I've had to rebuild [stuff] that I've built that got knocked down and do it again for the good of everyone. Whether it hurts you or not."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brendan also pointed out that amid all his surgeries, he was welcoming his three kids and watching them grow up (they're all teens or older now). So life was happening, even if he wasn't walking red carpets or appearing on hit TV shows every year.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is 'Beetlejuice' Star Geena Davis Retired From Acting?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7RnqWdmZ5is7Ot0p6pZquZo7CmedOhnGalpaK6uns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
