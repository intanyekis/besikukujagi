He was accompanied by one of the family’s dogs in a snowy wilderness, appropriately attired for the cold.&nbsp;</p><p>An exclusive look at Umansky’s participation in The Skinny Confidential was given to PEOPLE last month. He talked about his relationship status with Richards on the Him & Her Show podcast, as well as his wish for others to stay out of his personal life.</p><p>“I’ll update all of you when I have a clear plan for my marriage. Everyone may go hiking and f— off until then,” he declared.&nbsp;</p><p>Mauricio Umansky also said that he won’t watch RHOBH episodes about his upcoming split because “it will make more noise.” He went on to say that he doesn’t “need to read the BS” about headlines and remarks because he is aware of the couple’s breakup.</p><p>In addition, the father of four offered guidance on how to maintain their nearly thirty-year marriage.</p><p>“Use your creativity to find things, to collaborate, to exercise creativity, and to try new things,” he remarked. The Bravo actress has discussed her breakup with Umansky on the RHOBH multiple times, and she has been outspoken about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Richards stated she “needed a little freedom” in a talk earlier this season regarding spending less time with Umansky with her pal and coworker Dorit Kemsley.”It’s been difficult,” Richards remarked during a tease of the programme on Live with Kelly and Mark.</p><p>“For me, this is unfamiliar territory. It’s been challenging,” she remarked in October. “Thankfully, it was cordial. My four dearest friends and our daughters, who have been incredible, are my primary worries. It’s difficult.”</p><p>“Despite being apart for some time, Kyle and Mauricio continue to share a home. As they decide what’s next for them and their family, they continue to get along well,” a source told PEOPLE in July.</p><p>Bravo broadcasts The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills every Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7wJ%2BrnqpdqL2ttdOtoKefXay2tbSMpLClnV2ntqS0wKubrGWdlsKztcKipmatnZa7tLfYZqCsZaOlsq%2BwyKeeZqyZorJuw8itn2aclai2qLrEq2SapJWtrq%2Bw0aKYZq%2BfobOmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
