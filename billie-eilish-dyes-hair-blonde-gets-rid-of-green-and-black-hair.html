The gorgeous new look left Us speechless! On the other hand though, her fans have quite a lot to say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Billie-Eilish-Ditches-Green-Hair-Looks-Totally-Different-As-A-Blonde-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>In fact, the news that Billie went blonde raked in more than 1 million likes on her in-feed post in under 6 minutes. Talk about breaking the internet!</p><p class=p1>The 19-year-old star’s shaggy style is attracting tons of attention from fellow celebs. <strong>James Charles</strong> piped up in the comments, writing, “Oh my god you are stunning it’s unreal.” <strong>Skai Jackson</strong> also clapped back at Eilish’s caption, “pinch me,” writing, “No, pinch me.”</p><p class=p1>Fans are equally as obsessed with the “Therefore I Am” singer’s new look, but many knew that a change was coming. Back in December 2020, Eilish dropped a clue in an Instagram live. She said, “I’m changing it [my hair] after the doc comes out,” referring to her documentary <i>The World’s a Little Blurry. </i>“It will be the end of an era. I’m going to give you a new era.” And a new era we got!</p><p class=p1>That said, there’s much speculation that the blonde transformation actually occurred days prior to the big announcement. In fact, may suspect that Eilish wore a wig (with a Gucci jacquard-print bucket hat) in both recent photos and to the Sunday, March 14 Grammy Awards.</p><p class=p1>The unconfirmed evidence lies in many TikTok conspiracy videos, with people point out that normally Eilish’s natural roots peek through. Recently though, her roots have been entirely green, indicative of a wig.</p><p class=p1>Add that to the fact that in recent appearance she’s sported bandanas, hats and headpieces that cover her hairline.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Regardless of if there’s any credibility to such speculation, it seems as though a blonde Billie is here to stay — at least for now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e2rbjInmSeoZyewKl5w7KcrGWYlrazecGlpqeclWK0psDSZqminF2ks26z0Z6cp2WRo7FursuamqRlmJa2s3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
