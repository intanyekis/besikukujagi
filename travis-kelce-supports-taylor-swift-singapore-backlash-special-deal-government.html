The singer reportedly has a special deal with the government where she’s being paid per concert, given how much hosting Taylor is expected to boost the country’s tourism revenue. According to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor is being paid $3 million per show</a> by the Singapore government.</p><p>It's a decision that’s not sitting well with everyone – and we’re not just talking about Swifties – since Taylor isn’t stopping in any neighbouring countries (like Thailand and Indonesia) given the exclusive deal.</p><p>Thai PM Srettha Thavisin, for example, has been very critical of Taylor’s decision to accept the Singapore government’s offer, saying, "If [Swift] came to Thailand, it would have been cheaper to organize it here, and I believe she would be able to attract more sponsors and tourists to Thailand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, "Even though we would have to subsidize at least 500m baht ($14 million USD), it would be worth it."</p><p>The controversy has even sparked Singpore officials to respond, though the governmet isn’t confirming how much Swift was paid. "Due to business confidentiality, we cannot reveal the specific size and conditions of the grant," Singapore’s Culture Minister Edwin Tong told the media, adding the price is “not anywhere as high as speculated.”</p><p>With reports that <a href=#>Travis will also be joining Taylor in Europe</a>, it seems like fans can expect to see him at many of her upcoming shows. Travis previously joined Taylor in Australia where she had multiple performances scheduled. Paparazzi caught the couple visiting a local zoo, <a href=#>which sparked controversy from PETA</a>, who said the couple should’ve picked a more responsible location for a date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lo6q9sbvRrapmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kYsCqusaap6iqlWKvoq%2FKpZisoF2ovaavyJqjZpyVlrlus86vnKumnZq7tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
