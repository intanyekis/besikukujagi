According to the Netflix description, "an ultimatum is issued—and in just over eight weeks, they must commit to marriage, or move on. In the meantime, each will choose a new potential partner from one of the other couples, in a life-changing opportunity to get a glimpse of two different possible futures."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Netflix's Dating Around: Interesting Facts About Making The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-hosting-39-the-ultimatum-marry-or-move-on-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Who Is Hosting 'The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On'?</span></h2><p>If you are a fan of dating shows, you might recognize these familiar faces.
